Changes in Carrying Value

On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the estimated net realizable values, liquidation costs and the estimated date of the completion of the liquidation of the Company and records any significant changes. If the Company has a change in its plan for the disposition of an asset, the carrying value will be adjusted to reflect this change in the period that the change is approved. The change in value may also include a change to the accrued liquidation costs related to the asset.

All changes in the estimated liquidation value of the Company’s assets, real estate assets, or other assets and liabilities, are reflected as a change to the Company’s net assets in liquidation.
