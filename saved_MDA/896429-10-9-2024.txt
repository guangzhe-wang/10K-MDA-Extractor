Active Devices on our service include POS electronic payment devices, certified payment software, or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals. Customers can obtain POS electronic payment devices from us in the following ways:

•Purchasing devices directly from the Company or one of its authorized resellers;

•Financing devices under the Company’s QuickStart Program, which are non-cancellable 60-months sales-type leases directly from the Company; and

•Renting devices under the Company's Cantaloupe ONE program, which are typically 36-months duration agreements.

Highlights

Highlights of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 are below:

•Revenues of $269 million, an increase of 10% year over year, led by higher transaction and subscription fees revenue;

•$3.0 billion in dollar volume of transactions for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 15%;

•1.22 million Active Devices as of June 30, 2024 compared to 1.17 million as of June 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 55 thousand Active Devices, or 5%;

•31,466 Active Customers to our service as of June 30, 2024 compared to 28,584 as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 2,882 Active Customers, or 10%;

•We acquired Cheq, which offers a portfolio of POS solutions that include both register and self-service kiosk ordering, handheld devices for taking payments on-the-go, and mobile app ordering for pick-up or in-seat delivery – serving the sports stadium, entertainment venues and festival industries;

•We launched Seed Analytics and Seed Intelligence, two new premium analytics tools available within the Seed Pro platform, designed to transform the way vending operators leverage data for business growth with improved decision-making and enhanced productivity;

•Continued our thought-leadership initiatives, including the release of our 2024 Micropayment Trends Report, which studied micro payment trends (transactions less than $10) at food and beverage vending and at amusement machines throughout the United States and Canada in 2023;

•In February 2024, we held our annual user conference, Cantaloupe University, in Las Vegas, NV, where we showcased our latest technologies and provided two days of training and education around our entire platform and suite of products; and

•We showcased our full suite of solutions for the European and Mexico markets at Cantaloupe LIVE in the Milton-Keynes, U.K. and Mexico City, Mexico. Both events allowed customers, partners and industry professionals to see the latest technology for self-service retail serving their respective markets. We also showcased our cashless device the P30, the Seed platform, micro market technology and our smart coolers with age verification solutions at various industry trade shows within Mexico.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The self-service industry is highly competitive with service providers ranging from well-established enterprises to early-stage companies within the financial technology and software services industries. The markets for our products and services are characterized by evolving industry standards, aggressive pricing, continuous innovation, and changing consumer trends. We believe the following macroeconomic conditions and specific industry trends and uncertainties are most likely to impact our financial results: 

•Our ability to meet rising demand from the increased adoption of cashier-less models via vending machines, self-service kiosks, and mobile ordering as consumer preferences for use of faster, simpler and more seamless digital purchase and payment experiences continues to grow;

•Our ability to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services and to successfully target, acquire and integrate new businesses;

•The broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including a potentially sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including as a result of supply chain disruptions, geopolitical conflicts (including the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas), political uncertainty, inflationary pressure, elevated interest rates or interest rate fluctuations such as those that occurred recently; and

•Ongoing labor challenges and inflation drive increased utility of actionable operational business intelligence from new technologies like machine learning and AI to drive operational efficiencies and operational transparency through modern, cloud-based logistics and inventory management solutions.

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our business performance and our financial and operating results, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

KEY METRICS

The following table shows certain financial and non-financial data that management believes give readers insight into certain trends and relationships about the Company’s financial performance. We believe the metrics (Active Devices, Active Customers, Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions) are useful in allowing management and readers to evaluate our strategy of driving growth in devices and transactions.

Active Devices 

Active Devices are devices that have communicated with us or have had a transaction in the last twelve months. Included in the number of Active Devices are devices that communicate through other devices that communicate or transact with us. For example, a self-service retail location that utilizes an ePort cashless payment device as well as Seed management services constitutes only one device.

Active Customers

The Company defines Active Customers as all customers with at least one Active Device.

Total Number Of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions

Transactions are defined as electronic payment transactions that are processed by our technology-enabled solutions. Management uses Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions to evaluate the effectiveness of our new customer strategy and ability to leverage existing customers and partners. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cost of subscription and transaction fees excludes amortization of certain technology assets, see below. 
Amortization of internal-use software assets and developed technology assets. 
The Company's internal-use software assets and developed technology assets are not associated with equipment sales.

Revenues

Total revenues increased by $25.0 million, or 10%, from $243.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, to $268.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The increase was attributable to a $31.3 million increase in subscription and transaction fees, partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in equipment sales. 

The increase in subscription and transaction fees was primarily driven by increased processing volumes, with an approximately 15% increase in total dollar volumes for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. Our transaction fees increased $23.6 million, or 18%, due to an increase in the average price per transaction and Total Number of Transactions relative to the prior year. Our subscription fees increased approximately $7.7 million, or 11% for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior year which was attributed to a focus of management on growing our recurring subscription services to our customer base and a 5% increase in the Active Devices count compared to last year. Our Cheq acquisition contributed $2.1 million in subscription and transaction fees for the year ended June 30, 2024. 

The decrease in equipment sales for the year ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the upgrades of some of our customers from 3G to 4G network compatible devices in 2023, with these upgrades substantially complete in 2024.

Costs of sales 

Costs of sales increased $3.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was attributed to a $11.7 million increase in Cost of subscription and transaction fees, partially offset by a $8.1 million decrease in equipment costs. Cost of subscription and transaction fees increased $11.7 million primarily due to corresponding increases in transaction processing fee revenue and transaction processing volumes. Cost of equipment sales decreased $8.1 million primarily due to a decrease in the volume of equipment sold during the current fiscal year as a result of 3G to 4G upgrades as described above.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses. Operating expenses increased by $8.0 million, or 9.9%, for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The change was primarily attributed to an increase of $4.5 million in general and administrative expenses, a $7.9 million increase in sales and marketing costs, a $3.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization. This increase was partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in integration and acquisition expense, a $1.2 million decrease in investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, and a $4.2 million decrease in technology and product development expenses. See further details within individual categories below.

Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $7.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to higher sales and marketing employee personnel cost in the current year, to support our expanding business and service offerings in the United States and international markets. 

Technology and product development. Technology and product development expenses decreased approximately $4.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the current year was driven by lower expensed personnel costs as we continued to invest in internal-use software which resulted in higher capitalized costs compared to the prior year. We focus on investing in innovative technologies, specifically advancing mobile enhancements across the Seed platform, Cantaloupe Go and the mobile loyalty platform for consumers. Additional expenses in technology were incurred to further strengthen our network environment and platform, which will provide our customers greater stability, reliability, and overall higher performance on processing transactions and transmitting data.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.9 million increase in personnel compensation cost, as a result of our growing business, including a 33% increase to our headcount year-over-year, a $2.8 million increase in consulting professional services spent as part of our remediation of previously identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and $0.4 million increase in rent expense. These increases were offset by a $0.8 million decrease in travel and entertainment and a $0.6 million decrease from the release of sales tax reserves.

Investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries. In April 2024, we agreed to a net settlement of approximately $1.5 million with a third-party insurance carrier related to the reimbursement of expenses associated with the 2019 Investigation. The settlement was recognized as a gain in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2024. During fiscal year 2023, we reached a settlement with the SEC to resolve its 2019 Investigation, which included a civil monetary penalty payment of $1.5 million. The penalty payment was fully paid to the SEC as of June 30, 2023. During fiscal year 2023, we received a $2.0 million reimbursement from its directors and officers (D&O) insurance policy for legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2019 Investigation. The D&O reimbursement proceeds were recorded as a reduction of “Investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses, net of insurance recoveries” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. For additional information, refer to Note 18 – Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual report. 

Integration and acquisition. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred professional service fees of $1.2 million from accounting, legal, investing banking advisors and consulting services for the successful completion of the Cheq acquisition, as well as post-acquisition costs associated with the integration process. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company incurred professional service fees of $3.1 million from accounting, legal, investing banking advisors and consulting services for the successful completion of the 32M acquisition, as well as post-acquisition costs associated with the integration process.

Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $2.2 million increase in depreciation on internal-use software and a $0.5 million increase in amortization of intangible assets as a result of 12 months of 32M acquisition compared to 7 months in year ended June 30, 2023 and as a result of the Cheq acquisition. Our increase in internal-use software is attributable to management's focus on developing innovative technologies to further strengthen our network environment and platform.

Other income (expense), Net 

Other income (expense), Net

Total other expense, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was $1.2 million, compared to an income of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. Our interest expense increased $0.6 million primarily due to 12 months of interest on our additional borrowing of $25 million to fund a portion of the 32M acquisition in December 2022 in fiscal 2024, compared to 7 months of interest in fiscal 2023.

Interest income decreased $0.5 million due to a decrease in the finance receivables balance associated with our equipment financing program. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not a substitute for or a measure of our profitability or net earnings

Adjusted Gross Profit and Margin

We define Adjusted Gross Profit as revenue less cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation of internally-developed software and amortization of intangible assets related to technologies obtained through acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to view the resulting figures excluding the aforementioned non-cash charges because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and such amounts vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenue. We have provided below a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:

Amortization of internal-use software assets and developed technology assets.

Total Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP) was 38.2% for the year ended June 30, 2024, from 33.3% for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase in Adjusted Gross Margin was primarily driven by an increase in our subscription fees revenue which is inherently a higher margin revenue stream. Additionally, our equipment sales gross margins improved from the prior year primarily driven by the diversification of our equipment sales and higher margins on certain micro market equipment.

Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net income before (i) interest income on cash and leases, (ii) interest expense on debt and sales tax reserves, (iii) income tax provision, (iv) depreciation, (v) amortization, (vi) stock-based compensation expense, (vii) fees and charges, net of reimbursement from insurance proceeds, that were incurred in connection with the 2019 Investigation and financial statement restatement activities as well as proxy solicitation costs that are not indicative of our core operations, (viii) one-time project expense, one-time severance expenses, and infrequent integration and acquisition expense, and (ix) certain other significant infrequent or unusual losses and gains that are not indicative of our core operations including asset impairment charges, and gain on extinguishment of debt.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors in comparing our financial performance to other companies and from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating 

performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and interest income, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. Additionally, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA as a metric in our executive officer and management incentive compensation plans.

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new asset acquisitions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. Adjusted EBITDA also does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces the cash available to us; or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. The expenses and other items which are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their financial results.

Below is a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:

(a) We have excluded stock-based compensation, as it does not reflect our cash-based operations. 
(b) We have excluded the costs and corresponding reimbursements related to the 2019 Investigation, because we believe that they represent charges that are not related to our core operations. During the year ended June 30, 2024, we received $1.5 million in insurance reimbursement for legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2019 Investigation. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA contains a negative adjustment.

(c) We have excluded expenses incurred in connection with business acquisitions as it does not represent recurring costs or charges related to our core operations.

(d) Consists of expenses incurred in connection with non-recurring severance charges related to work force reduction.

(e) Consists of expenses incurred in connection with fully remediating previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. See Item 9A Section e - Remediation of Prior Material Weaknesses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources and Uses of Cash

Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, debt financings, and equity issuances. Our primary sources of capital available are cash and cash equivalents on hand of $58.9 million as of June 30, 2024 and the cash that we expect to be provided by operating activities.

We believe that our current financial resources will be sufficient to fund its current twelve-month operating budget from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. Our primary focus as part of our core operations to increase cash flow from operating activities is to prioritize collection efforts to reduce outstanding accounts receivable, utilize existing inventory to support equipment sales over the next year, focusing on various operational efficiencies to improve overall profitability of the business and continued to grow our business both domestically and internationally.

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $27.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to $14.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. We recognized $12.0 million in net income and incurred $23.6 million in non-cash operating charges, partially offset by $7.8 million cash utilized in working capital accounts. 

The change in working capital balance was primarily driven by a $21.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $9.4 million increase in inventory, offset by a $18.5 million increase in accounts receivable, a $4.0 million increase to our provision for credit losses and sales and a $3.7 million increase in finance receivables. The increase in inventory was a result of the Company expansion plans in Mexico and the UK. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as accounts receivable is primarily due to merchant accounts in processing at year end.

Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to $51.9 million in the prior year. We paid $3.7 million in cash for the Cheq acquisition and invested $14.9 million in capital expenditures as the Company focuses on investing in innovative technologies and products, and increasing rental devices enrolled in the Company's Cantaloupe One program. In fiscal year 2023, we paid $35.7 million in cash for the 32M acquisition and invested $16.2 million in property and equipment.

Net cash used in or provided by financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. In fiscal year 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $20.5 million which was primarily contributed from an additional $25.0 million borrowed to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the 32M acquisition. We used $2.2 million cash to repurchase our Series A Convertible Stock and made a $1.0 million payment for contingent consideration relating to the 2022 Yoke acquisition.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had certain contractual obligations due over a period of time as summarized in the following table:

(a) Our debt and financing obligations include both principal and interest obligations. As of June 30, 2024, an interest rate of 9.0% was used to compute the amount of the contractual obligations for interest on the JPMorgan Credit Agreement. See Note 7 - Debt and Other Financing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

(b) Operating lease obligations represent our undiscounted operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2024. See Note 6 - Leases to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”, "GAAP"), and they conform to general practices in our industry. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and strategic or economic assumptions may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. We apply critical accounting estimates consistently from period to period and intend that any change in methodology occur in an appropriate manner. 

Accounting estimates currently deemed critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations are listed below. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

Revenue Recognition. The Company derives revenue primarily from the sale or lease of equipment and services to the small ticket, unattended POS market.

The Company’s application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements may require significant judgment in contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. 

The Company assesses the goods and/or services promised in each customer contract and separately identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a distinct good or service. The Company then allocates the transaction price to those performance obligations in the contract using relative standalone selling prices where applicable. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which a good or service is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through historic data, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all reasonably available information, including market data, trends, as well as other company- or customer-specific factors.

Certain contracts require significant contract interpretation to determine appropriate accounting due to complex arrangements with nonstandard contract terms. In particular, the determination of whether the Company is principal (gross revenue) or agent (net revenue) in a transaction can require significant judgement. A change in this judgement could result in a significant reduction in the Company's revenues, but no impact to the Company's net income. Certain contracts also require significant judgement related to the relative standalone selling prices and the allocation to equipment and subscription services. A change in these judgements could result in a significant change in the timing of the Company's revenue recognition.

Capitalization of internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. We have significant expenditures associated with the technological maintenance and improvement of our network and technology offerings. These expenditures include both the cost of internal employees, who spend portions of their time on various technological projects, and the use of external temporary labor and consultants. Capitalization of internal-use software occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. We are required to assess these expenditures and make a determination as to whether the costs should be expensed as incurred or are subject to capitalization. In making these determinations, we consider the stage of the development project, the probability of successful development and if the development is resulting in increased features and functionality. In addition, if we determine that a project qualifies for capitalization, the amount of capitalization is subject to various estimates, including the amount of time spent on the development work and the cost of internal employees and external consultants. Internal-use software is included within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 7 years.

We capitalize certain costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements) following the internal-use software capitalization criteria described above. Our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support internal corporate functions, our platforms and technology offerings. Capitalized costs relating to cloud computing arrangements are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 5 years.

Significant judgements include whether a project qualifies for capitalization, whether costs incurred directly relate to a project, and the stage of the project's development. There have been no changes in the Company's capitalization judgements.

Business Combinations. The Company allocates the acquisition purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. The excess of total consideration over the fair 

values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We engage a third-party valuation firm to assist in establishing the fair value of the acquired intangible assets. We may adjust certain fair value estimates deemed provisional as of the acquisition date during the measurement period upon which we may obtain additional information needed to identify and more accurately measure the consideration transferred, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed.

Income Taxes. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income, as well as management’s judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards. The carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management’s interpretations of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. 

We evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-term business forecasts to provide insight. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.

As the Company has recently been profitable, significant judgement is involved in determining if and when the Company's valuation allowance could be released as well as the amount of the release (full or partial). Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are reserved with a full valuation allowance because, based on the available evidence, the Company believes it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future. If the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. 

Sales tax reserve. The Company has recorded estimated liabilities for current and historical sales taxes, which are included in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues interest on the unpaid balance. The estimated liability is adjusted upon the payment of sales tax related to the accrual, the changes in state tax laws that may impact the accrual and the expiration of the statute of limitations for open years under review.

Significant judgement is inherent in the methodology utilized to determine the historical sales tax reserve. The liability includes significant judgments and estimates that may change in the future, and the actual liability may be different from our current estimate. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
