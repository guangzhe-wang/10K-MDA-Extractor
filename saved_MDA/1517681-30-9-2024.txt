Overview

The Company was originally formed in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on October 15, 2007 as Propanc PTY LTD. On November 23, 2010, Propanc Health Group Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware and in January 2011, to reorganize our Company, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Propanc PTY LTD on a one-for-one basis, whereby Propanc PTY LTD became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective April 20, 2017, we changed our name to “Propanc Biopharma, Inc.” to better reflect our current stage of operations and development.

We are a development-stage healthcare company that is currently focused on developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancer. Utilizing our scientific and oncology consultants, we have developed a rational, composite formulation of anti-cancer compounds, which together exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and spreading through the body. Our lead product candidate, PRP, is a variation upon our novel formulation and involves pro-enzymes, the inactive precursors of enzymes.

Recent Developments

On August 7, 2024, we received written consent in lieu of a meeting by the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of August 7, 2024 and our Board of Directors approving such actions as are necessary for us to proceed to, and accordingly intends to, effectuate and execute a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio somewhere between one post-split share per ten thousand pre-split shares (1:10,000) and one post-split share per one hundred thousand pre-split shares (1:100,000) (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Proportional adjustments for the Reverse Stock Split will be made to our outstanding stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans. We are awaiting the approval of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) for the market effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split.

Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. The results discussed below are of the Company and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Propanc PTY LTD.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023

Revenue

For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated no revenue because we are currently undertaking research and development activities for market approval and no sales were generated in this period.

Administration Expense

Administration expense decreased to $1,253,797 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $1,499,885 for the year ended June 30, 2023. This decrease of approximately $246,000 is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $156,000 in general consulting, legal and investor relation fees and decrease in stock-based expenses of approximately $136,000, decrease of approximately $40,000 in employee remuneration expense and decrease in accounting fees of approximately $11,000 offset by increase in marketing expenses of approximately $91,000 and increase in other general and administrative expenses of approximately $5,000.

Occupancy Expense

Occupancy expenses increased to $34,150 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $28,841 for the year ended June 30, 2023. This increase of approximately $5,000 is primarily attributable to exchange rate movements over the period when compared to the same period in 2023.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were increased to $248,102 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $247,919 for the year ended June 30, 2023, an increase in research and development expenses of approximately $180.

Such research and development expenses are related to the two-year collaboration agreement with University of Jaén, which was executed in October 2020 to provide certain research services to the Company ending on October 2022, relating to the investigation of a fully synthetic recombinant version of PRP. Additionally, on July 27, 2022, the Company entered into another two-year research agreement with the University of Jaén to provide certain research and experiment services to the Company relating to the investigation of the effects of pancreatic proenzymes against the tumor microenvironment.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased to $665,841 for the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $532,821 for the year ended June 30, 2023. Interest expense is primarily comprised of approximately $574,000 of debt discount amortization and accretion of put premium and $79,000 of interest expense from accrual of interest expense and other financing fees for the year ended June 30, 2024. This increase in interest expense of approximately $133,000 is primarily attributable to the increase in amortization of debt discount of approximately $91,000 and increase of approximately $47,000 in accretion of put.

Derivative Expense

Derivative expense were increased to $141,012 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $0 for the year ended June 30, 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to the issuance of convertible notes in August 2023, October 2023 and April 2024 to GS Capital which initial value was bifurcated from the embedded conversion option and was recorded as derivative expense.

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities

Change in fair value of derivative liabilities were increased to a gain of $316,537 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a loss of $(530,330) for the year ended June 30, 2023. This increase in gain of approximately $847,000 is primarily attributable to the decrease in fair value of the principal amount of convertible notes with bifurcated embedded conversion option derivatives as a result of the decrease in stock prices during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Gain from Settlement of accounts payable

Gain from settlement of accounts payable was $0 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $17,499 for the year ended June 30, 2023. On August 16, 2022, the Company and a third-party investor relations consultant agreed to settle an outstanding payable of $23,050 in exchange for 2,305,000 warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock at $0.01 per share with an expiry date of August 16, 2025 and fair market value of $5,551. Accordingly, the Company recognized gain from settlement of accounts payable of $17,499 during the year ended June 30, 2023.

Gain on Extinguishment of Debt, net

During the year ended June 30, 2024, convertible notes with principal aggregate amount of convertible notes of $130,800, accrued interest of $8,700 and conversion fees of $3,832 containing bifurcated embedded conversion option derivatives were converted into common stock. Accordingly, the fair market value of the shares issued upon conversion was $352,565, resulting in a loss on extinguishment at the time of conversion of $209,233 and $263,798 of derivative liability fair value was recorded as a gain on extinguishment at the time of conversion, resulting in a net gain of $54,565 which is included in gain on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

During the year ended June 30, 2023, the principal aggregate amount of convertible notes of $168,200, accrued interest of $16,632 and conversion fees of $1,838 containing bifurcated embedded conversion option derivatives were converted into common stock. Accordingly, the fair market value of the shares issued upon conversion was $556,272, resulting in a loss on extinguishment at the time of conversion of $369,602 and $352,051 of derivative liability fair value was recorded as a gain on extinguishment at the time of conversion, resulting in a net loss of $17,551 which is included in gain on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, during the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized the remaining put premium of $43,520 related to a convertible note into gain on extinguishment of debt. The holder of such convertible note agreed to surrender all conversion rights in its currently held convertible notes due to violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, which resulted in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $25,969 for the year ended June 30, 2023.

Foreign Currency Transaction Gain

Foreign currency transaction gain increased to a gain of $22,080 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a gain of $5,885 for the year ended June 30, 2023. This increase of approximately $16,000 is partially attributable to the increase in exchange rates during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Net loss

Net loss decreased to $1,820,528 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of $2,660,566 for the year ended June 30, 2023. The change relates to the factors discussed above.

Deemed dividend

The Company recognized the value of the effect of a down round feature related to our Series A warrants when triggered. Upon the occurrence of the triggering event that resulted in a reduction of the strike price, the Company measured the value of the effect of the feature as the difference between the fair value of the warrants without the down round feature or before the strike price reduction and the fair value of the warrants with a strike price corresponding to the reduced strike price upon the down round feature being triggered. Accordingly, the Company recognized deemed dividend of $192,960 and $466,273 during the year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with a corresponding reduction of income available to common stockholders upon the alternate cashless exercise of these warrants during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net loss available to common stockholders

Net loss available to common stockholders decreased to $2,013,488 for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of $3,126,839 for the year ended June 30, 2023. This decrease of approximately $1,067,000 is primarily attributable to the change relates to the factors discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Current Financial Condition

As of June 30, 2024, we had total assets of $72,365, comprised primarily of cash of $21,085, GST tax receivable of $2,950, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1,406, deferred offering cost of $27,117, security deposit of $2,008, and operating lease ROU asset, net of $17,799. As compared to June 30, 2023, we had total assets of $60,328, comprised primarily of cash of $10,047, GST tax receivable of $2,867, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6,125, property and equipment, net, of $302, operating lease ROU asset, net of $38,988, and security deposit of $1,999.

We had current liabilities of $3,792,782, primarily comprised of net convertible debt of $399,325, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2,100,137, employee benefit liability of $639,371, loans payable of $145,091, loans payable – related party of $71,629, note payable, net of $204,694 and embedded conversion option liabilities of $133,886 as of June 30, 2024. As compared to June 30, 2023, we had current liabilities of $3,158,229, primarily comprised of net convertible debt of $390,539, loans payable of $65,280, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,546,425, employee benefit liability of $587,618, and embedded conversion option liabilities of $423,209.

We have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and/or convertible securities for cash. The cash was used primarily for payments for research and development, administration expenses, occupancy expenses, professional fees, consultants and travel.

During the year ended June 30, 2024 we received proceeds from issuance of note of $190,000, proceeds from issuance of convertible notes of $567,050, proceeds from sale of common stock of $23,057, and total proceeds from issuance of loans payable including from a related party of $304,696.

We have substantial capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception. As of June 30, 2024, we had $21,085 in cash. We depend upon debt and/or equity financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our current business plan. Such capital requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and for which we currently have commitments. Therefore, we presently do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the next 12 months. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may curtail our plan of operations. We will be required to obtain alternative or additional financing from financial institutions, investors or otherwise, in order to maintain and expand our existing operations. The failure by us to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations, and adversely affecting our ability to complete ongoing activities in connection with our research and development programs.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was $935,118, for the year ended June 30, 2024, due to our net loss of $1,820,528 offset primarily by non-cash charges of amortization of debt discount of $294,005, non-cash interest expense of $3,832, accretion of put premium of $279,711, derivative expense of $141,012, addback change in fair value of derivatives of $316,537, foreign currency transaction gain of $22,080, and gain from extinguishment of debt of $54,565. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $538,376, which is primarily attributable to increase accrued interest of $78,733, increase in accounts payable of $242,408, and increase in accrued expenses and other payables of $209,962.

Net cash used in operating activities was $1,105,251 for the year ended June 30, 2023, due to our net loss of $2,660,566 offset primarily by non-cash charges of amortization of debt discount of $202,952, total stock-based compensation of $141,356, non-cash interest expense of $1,838, accretion of put premium of $232,674, change in fair value of derivatives of $530,330, foreign currency transaction gain of $5,885, and $25,969 gain on extinguishment of debt. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $472,587, which is primarily attributable to increase in accounts payable of $80,975, increase in accrued expenses and other payables of $130,511, employee benefit liability of $186,912, and accrued interest of $92,474.

Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2024 were $941,894 as compared to $1,113,719 for the year ended June 30, 2023. During the year ended June 30, 2024 we received net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes of $567,050, proceeds from issuance of note of $190,000, total proceeds from issuance of loans including from a related party of $304,696, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock of $23,057 offset by repayment of convertible note of $142,909.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $1,113,719. During the year ended June 30, 2023 we received proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $475,000, proceeds from sale of common stock of $24,711, collections of subscription receivables of $23,758 and proceeds from issuance of convertible notes of $590,250.

Effect of Exchange Rate

The effect of the exchange rate on cash resulted in a $4,262 positive adjustment to cash flows in the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a $2,488 negative adjustment to cash flows in the year ended June 30, 2023. The reason for the fluctuation is due to the application of currency translation rates throughout the cash flow statement, the volume of transactions within each period and the daily fluctuation in exchange rates.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Below is a discussion of our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining (i) the methodology used in calculating the estimates, (ii) the inherent uncertainties pertaining to such estimates, and (iii) the possible effects of a significant variance in actual experience, from that of the estimate, on our financial condition. Estimates involve numerous assumptions that, if incorrect, could create a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Reference is frequently made herein to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). This is the source of authoritative US GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied to non-governmental entities. Each ASC reference in this filing is presented with a three-digit number, which represents its Topic. As necessary for explanation and as applicable, an ASC topic may be followed with a two-digit subtopic, a two-digit section or a two-or-three-digit paragraph.

Derivative Instruments: ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings. On the date of conversion, or payoff, of debt, we record the fair value of the conversion shares, remove the fair value of the related derivative liability, remove any discounts and record a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Please see section captioned “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.

Going Concern Qualification

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company had no revenues, had a net loss of $1,820,528 and had net cash used in operations of $935,118. Additionally, as of June 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit, stockholders’ deficit and accumulated deficit of $3,767,341, $3,779,059, and $66,698,220, respectively.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has included a “Going Concern Qualification” in their audit report for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, we have negative working capital and convertible debt that is past maturity that we are currently negotiating with lenders in order to amend the maturity dates. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from the issue date of this report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our strategy and on our ability to raise additional funds and/or to consummate a public offering. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity and/or convertible debt financing. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The “Going Concern Qualification” might make it substantially more difficult to raise capital.

Successful completion of the Company’s development program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities, acceptance of the Company’s patent applications, obtaining additional sources of suitable and adequate financing and ultimately achieving a level of sales adequate to support the Company’s cost structure and business plan. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on its ability to further develop and execute on its business plan. However, there can be no assurances that any or all of these endeavors will be successful.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
