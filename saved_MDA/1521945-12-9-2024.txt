: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K (the "Annual Report"). In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" appearing elsewhere herein.

The terms "PFLOAT," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" mean Prospect Floating Rate and Alternative Income Fund, Inc. unless the context specifically requires otherwise.

Overview

We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). Our investment objective is to generate current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Under normal market conditions, we will invest at least 80% of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in floating rate loans and other income producing investments. We will provide shareholders with 60 days' advanced notice prior to changing this 80% investment policy. We intend to meet our investment objective by primarily lending to and investing in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue between $50 million and $2.5 billion. We have elected and intend to continue to qualify annually to be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

On November 5, 2021, we amended and restated the Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement") to reduce the base management fee and eliminate the incentive fee payable to the Adviser thereunder, effective as of January 1, 2022 and until the one year anniversary of the listing of the Company’s common stock on a national securities exchange. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by our Board of Directors, including all of our directors who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act), on June 14, 2024.

For additional information regarding the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, please refer to "Investment Advisory Fees" below. 

Our Adviser

Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser is led by John F. Barry III and M. Grier Eliasek, two senior executives with significant investment advisory and business experience. Mr. Barry currently controls our Adviser.

Fourth Quarter Highlights

Investment Transactions

We seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2024, we purchased $29,707,463 and $48,266,763, respectively, in investment securities (excluding short-term securities). During the same three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2024, there was a noncash restructured investment in the amount of $0 and $997,560, respectively. During the same three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2024, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $4,070,861 and $7,966,315, respectively, resulting 

in a total net portfolio growth of $25,636,602 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and a total net portfolio growth of $40,300,448 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024.

Debt Issuances and Redemptions 

During the year ended June 30, 2024, we fully repaid our Credit Facility (as defined herein). On September 21, 2023, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility"), by and among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent. In conjunction with the closing of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, we terminated the Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, there was a $27,800,000 balance on the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 10 within the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Equity Issuances

As part of the distribution reinvestment plan, we issued 22,281, 30,344 and 38,096 shares of our common stock on April 5, 2024, May 3, 2024 and June 7, 2024, respectively. 

On June 28, 2024, the Company accepted a subscription agreement from the Adviser for the sale of $10.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock at a purchase price per Share equal to the Company’s net asset value per Share as of June 30, 2024. A total of 2,096,436 shares were issued on July 1, 2024. The offer and sale of these shares are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a) thereof and Regulation D thereunder.

On March 31, 2024, the Company accepted a subscription agreement from the Adviser for the sale of $10.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock at a purchase price per Share equal to the Company’s net asset value per Share as of March 31, 2024. A total of 2,105,263 shares were issued on April 1, 2024. The offer and sale of these shares are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a) thereof and Regulation D thereunder.

On March 28, 2024, under our share repurchase program, we made a tender offer to purchase up to the number of shares of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock we could repurchase with the cash we retained during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 as a result of issuing shares through our distribution reinvestment plan to those shareholders who elected to receive their distributions in the form of additional shares rather than in cash. The total cash retained during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 as a result of issuing shares through our distribution reinvestment plan prior to this tender offer was approximately $102,413. The tender offer was for cash at a price equal to the net asset value per share as of April 30, 2024. The offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on April 29, 2024, and a total of 260,066 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer as of such date. In accordance with the terms of the offer, the Company purchased 21,698 shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $4.72 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $102,413. 

On June 28, 2024, under our share repurchase program, we made a tender offer to purchase up to the number of shares of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock we could repurchase with the cash we retained during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as a result of issuing shares through our distribution reinvestment plan to those shareholders who elected to receive their distributions in the form of additional shares rather than in cash. The total cash retained during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as a result of issuing shares through our distribution reinvestment plan prior to this tender offer was approximately $102,413. The tender offer was for cash at a price equal to the net asset value per share as of July 31, 2024. The offer had been originally scheduled to expire at 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on July 30, 2024. On August 5, 2024, the company amended the tender offer and extended the expiration date of the offer until 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, August 30, 2024, unless further extended.

Investments

Our investment objective is to generate current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Under normal market conditions, we will invest at least 80% of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in floating rate loans and other income producing investments. We intend to meet our investment objective by primarily lending to and investing in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets. We expect to focus primarily on directly originating senior secured first lien loans and senior secured second lien loans and making investments in syndicated senior secured first lien loans, syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt, of middle market companies in a broad range of industries. Syndicated secured loans refer to commercial loans provided by a group of lenders that are structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial or investment banks, known as arrangers. These loans are then sold (or syndicated) to other banks or institutional investors. Syndicated secured loans may have a first priority lien on a borrower’s assets (i.e., senior secured first lien loans), a second priority lien on a borrower’s assets (i.e., senior secured second lien loans), or a lower lien or unsecured position on the borrower’s assets (i.e., subordinated debt). We expect our target credit investments will typically have initial maturities between three and ten years and generally range in size between $1 million and $100 

million, although the investment size will vary with the size of our capital base. We expect that the majority of our debt investments will bear interest at floating interest rates, but our portfolio may also include fixed-rate investments. We also expect to make our investments directly through the primary issuance by the borrower or in the secondary market. "Risk-adjusted returns" refers to a measure of investment return per unit of risk and provides a framework to compare and evaluate investment opportunities with differing risk/return profiles. The term "risk-adjusted returns" does not imply that we employ low-risk strategies or that an investment should be considered a low-risk or no risk investment.

We will generally source our investments primarily through our Adviser. We believe the investment management team of our Adviser has a significant amount of experience in the credit business, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. Our Adviser has access to 126 professionals, 49 of whom perform investment advisory functions.

We expect to dynamically allocate our assets in varying types of investments based on our analysis of the credit markets, which may result in our portfolio becoming more concentrated in particular types of credit instruments (such as senior secured loans) and less invested in other types of credit instruments. The loans in which we intend to invest are often rated by a nationally recognized ratings organization, and generally carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than "Baa3" by Moody’s Investors Service or lower than "BBB-" by Standard & Poor’s Corporation - also known as "high yield" or "junk bonds"). However, we may also invest in non-rated debt securities.

To seek to enhance our returns, we may employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act.

As part of our investment objective to generate current income, we expect that at least 70% of our investments will consist primarily of directly originated or syndicated senior secured first lien loans, directly originated or syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt. We expect that up to 30% of our investments will consist of other securities, including private equity (both common and preferred), dividend-paying equity, royalties, and the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs"), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes ("SSNs"). The senior secured loans underlying our CLO investments are expected typically to be BB or B rated (non-investment grade, which are often referred to as "high yield" or "junk") and in limited circumstances, unrated, senior secured loans. 

As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, we have in the past and expect in the future to co-invest on a concurrent basis with certain affiliates, consistent with applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. On January 13, 2020, (amended on August 2, 2022), the parent company of the Adviser received an exemptive order from the SEC (the "Order") granting the ability to negotiate terms, other than price and quantity, of co-investment transactions with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain affiliates, including us, Prospect Capital Corporation and Priority Income Fund, Inc., subject to certain conditions included therein. Under the terms of the Order permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates, a majority of our independent directors who have no financial interest in the transaction must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. The Order also imposes reporting and record keeping requirements and limitations on transactional fees. We may only co-invest with certain entities affiliated with our Adviser in negotiated transactions originated by our Adviser or its affiliates in accordance with such Order and existing regulatory guidance. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These co-investment transactions may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest among us and the other participating accounts. To mitigate these conflicts, our Adviser and its affiliates will seek to allocate portfolio transactions for all of the participating investment accounts, including us, on a fair and equitable basis, taking into account such factors as the relative amounts of capital available for new investments, the applicable investment programs and portfolio positions, the clients for which participation is appropriate and any other factors deemed appropriate. We intend to make all of our investments in compliance with the 1940 Act and in a manner that will not jeopardize our status as a BDC or RIC.

As a BDC, we are permitted under the 1940 Act to borrow funds to finance portfolio investments. To enhance our opportunity for gain, we intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, TPIC’s stockholders approved a proposal allowing us to modify our asset coverage ratio requirement from 200% to 150%. As a result, we were allowed to increase our leverage capacity effective as of March 16, 2019. The use of leverage, although it may increase returns, may also increase the risk of loss to our investors, particularly if the level of our leverage is high and the value of our investments declines.

Revenues

We generate revenue in the form of dividends, interest and capital gains on the debt securities, equity interests and CLOs that we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue from our portfolio companies in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees will be recognized as earned.

Expenses

Our primary operating expenses will be the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. The advisory fees will compensate our Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.

We will bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:

• corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and management services agreement;

• the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

• the cost of effecting sales and repurchase of shares of our common stock and other securities; 

• investment advisory fees;

• fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;

• transfer agent and custodial fees;

• fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

• federal and state registration fees; 

• federal, state and local taxes; 

• independent directors’ fees and expenses; 

• costs of proxy statements, stockholders’ reports and notices;

• fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;

• direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone, and staff;

• fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

• costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; 

• brokerage commissions for our investments; 

• legal, accounting and other costs associated with structuring, negotiating, documenting and completing our investment transactions;

• all other expenses incurred by our Adviser, in performing its obligations, subject to the limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; and

• all other expenses incurred by either our Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments to our Administrator under the Administration Agreement (as defined herein) that will be based upon our allocable portion of its overhead and other expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief executive officer, CCO and chief financial officer and their respective staffs.

Reimbursement of our Administrator for Administrative Services

We will reimburse our Administrator for the administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. Such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. However, such reimbursement is made in an amount equal to the lower of the Administrator’s actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. We will not reimburse our Administrator for any services for which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of our Administrator.

Portfolio and Investment Activity

We seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2024, we purchased $29,707,463 and $48,266,763, respectively, in investment securities (excluding short-term securities). During the same three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2024, there was a noncash restructured investment in the amount of $0 and $997,560, respectively. During the same three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2024, sales and 

redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $4,070,861 and $7,966,315, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio growth of $25,636,602 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and a total net portfolio growth of $40,300,448 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $59,455,010, consisted of interests in 50 investments (94% in senior secured loans, 1% in equity/other and 5% in CLO - subordinated notes).

Our financial condition, including the fair value and performance of certain of our portfolio investments, may be materially impacted after June 30, 2024 by circumstances and events that are not yet known. To the extent our portfolio investments are adversely impacted by the renewed hostilities in the Middle East, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, or by other factors, we may experience a material adverse impact on our future net investment income, the underlying value of our investments, our financial condition and the financial condition of our portfolio investments. For additional information concerning risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors."

During the three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2023, there were no purchased investment securities (excluding short-term securities). During the same three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2023, there was a noncash restructured investment in the amount of $1,758,226 and $1,758,226, respectively. During the same three and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2023, sales and redemptions of investment securities, including noncash restructured investments (excluding short-term securities) were $9,800,313 and $13,977,527, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio decline of $(8,042,087) for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and a total net portfolio decline of $(12,219,301) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $21,915,187, consisted of interests in 43 investments (77% in senior secured loans, 1% in senior secured notes, 2% in equity/other and 20% in CLO - subordinated notes). 

Portfolio Holdings

As of June 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $59,455,010, consisted of interests in 21 portfolio companies and 24 structured subordinated notes. The following table presents certain selected information regarding our portfolio composition and weighted average yields as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023:

The table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such industries as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023:

As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we did not "control" any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. 

The following table shows the composition of our investment portfolio by level of control as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023:

Net Asset Value

During the year ended June 30, 2024, our net asset value increased by $16,569,698, due to capital and investment activities, while our net asset value per share decreased by $(1.41). For the year ended June 30, 2024, the decrease in net asset value per share was primarily attributable to an increase in net realized and net change in unrealized losses on investments of $(2,077,562), or $(0.55) per weighted average share. For the year ended June 30, 2024, our net asset value per share further decreased by $0.45 per share related to distributions and our net investment income (loss) of $(214,815). For the year ended June 30, 2024, our net asset value per share further decreased by $(0.02) per share from the realized loss on the extinguishment of debt, which decreased by $(66,844). The following table shows the calculation of net asset value per share as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.

Results of Operations 

Investment Income 

For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we generated $3,020,157, $3,290,629 and $3,104,502, respectively, in investment income in the form of interest and fees earned on our debt portfolio. Such revenues were primarily cash income and non-cash portions related to the accretion of discounts and PIK. For the year ended June 30, 2024, investment income was 

lower as we held fewer investments generating interest income for the first half of the year. This was partially offset by rising interest rates due to increases in SOFR rates and additional assets during the second half of the year. Although there were benefits to interest income due to the rising SOFR rates, our income from our structured subordinated notes decreased due to 13 additional investments with an effective yield estimated to be 0% for the year ended June 30, 2024, as expected future cash flows are anticipated to not be sufficient to repay these investments at cost as well as many investments exiting the reinvestment period.

For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, PIK interest included in interest income totaled $153,085, $19,781 and $778, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2024, PIK interest included in interest income was higher due to amendments on three investments which have now partial PIK interest. For the year ended June 30, 2023, PIK interest included in interest income was higher due to an amendment on one investment which now has partial PIK interest. 

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses before expense limitation support totaled $3,682,527, $3,223,344 and $2,969,303 for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These operating expenses consisted primarily of interest and credit facility expense, offering costs, base management fees, administrator costs, legal expense, valuation services and audit and tax expense. 

The base management fees for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were $447,554, $422,681 and $611,137. Base management fees were lower for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024, due to the reduction in average total assets. During the year ended June 30, 2024, average total assets increased due to the sale of the Company's Class A common stock and an increase in investments held. Management fees for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were waived. 

The interest and credit facility expense for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were $1,243,672, $1,258,907 and $648,025. The interest and credit facility expenses were lower for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, due to a reduction in the average outstanding credit facility balance which was partially offset by an increase in the average stated interest rate. For the year ended June 30, 2024, the average stated interest rate (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) was 7.80% under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and Credit Facility, and for the year ended June 30, 2023, the average stated interest rate (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) was 6.26% under the Credit Facility. The interest and credit facility expenses were lower for the year ended June 30, 2023, due to the decrease in the three-month interest rates. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the average stated interest rate (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) was 2.78% under the Credit Facility. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, average outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and Credit Facility was $8,199,454, $16,677,151 and $20,880,822, respectively. The interest expense is monitored during our monthly reporting.

The offering costs for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were $82,489, $4,585 and $188,774. The offering costs for the year ended June 30, 2024 were higher compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, due to the commencement of the Multi-Class Offering and the amortization of the initial costs associated with our initial registration statement on Form N-2 filed with the SEC for our Multi-Class Offering. 

The legal expenses for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were $90,036, $148,626 and $99,961. The legal expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 were higher compared to the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2022 due to additional costs associated with launching a private placement offering.

The valuation services for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were $35,491, $26,688 and $46,823. The valuation costs for the year ended June 30, 2024 were higher compared to the year ended June 30, 2023 due to an increase in investments held. The valuation costs for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were lower compared to the year ended June 30, 2022 due to leveraging the valuation services provided for co-investments.

The general and administrative expense for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were $177,599, $65,942 and $61,909. The general and administrative expense for the year ended June 30, 2024 was higher due to costs associated with proxy and other SEC filings. 

Pursuant to the expense limitation support payment (discussed below), the sponsor reimbursed the Company $(447,555), $(422,681) and $(611,137) for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Net Investment Income (Loss)

Our net investment income (loss) totaled $(214,815), $489,966 and $746,336 for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net investment income for the year ended June 30, 2024 was lower due to an increase in administrator expenses, valuation services, and general and administrative expense as well as a decrease in interest income. 

Net Realized Gains/Losses from Investments

We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized.

For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we received proceeds from sales and repayments on unaffiliated investments of $7,966,315, $12,219,301 and $13,141,266, from which we realized gains (losses) of $(2,087,522), $(848,927) and $0, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a realized loss from debt of $66,844 related to the termination of the Credit Facility. 

Net Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investments

Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net change in unrealized gains (losses) totaled $9,960, $(726,332) and $(2,505,932), respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2024, the fair value of our investments was negatively impacted by macro-economic challenges such as reduced demand, economic volatility, and inflationary pressures.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

We generate cash primarily from cash flows from fees (such as management fees), interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of funds is investments in companies, payments of our expenses and distributions to holders of our common stock.

Because many of our operating costs are not proportional to our size, including accounting/auditing, legal, insurance and administrative costs (which includes the reimbursement of the compensation of the chief financial officer, CCO, treasurer, secretary and other administrative personnel of our Administrator), we must raise sufficient capital in order to build a portfolio that generates sufficient revenue to cover our expenses. As of June 30, 2024, we have not raised sufficient capital to build a large enough portfolio to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. We have entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement ("ELA") with our Adviser, which, as a result of our Adviser waiving fees that we would otherwise be required to pay to it, has allowed us to make distributions to shareholders and pay some expenses. However, after December 31, 2024, our Adviser will no longer be contractually obligated to waive fees. Our Adviser, in its capacity as an affiliate of our former adviser, has in the past agreed to voluntarily waive fees, but there is no guarantee that it will do so and, if it does not, we will be required to sell our investments to cover our expenses.

We previously publicly offered for sale a maximum amount of $300,000,000 in shares of common stock on a "best efforts" basis. Triton Pacific was not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but would use its best efforts to sell the shares offered. The minimum investment in shares of our common stock in the offering was $5,000. Effective February 19, 2021, the offering was terminated and, as a result, the dealer manager agreement terminated in accordance with its terms and Triton Pacific ceased serving as our dealer manager effective as of such date. Effective September 19, 2022, we engaged the Dealer Manager as our dealer manager for our Private Offering. We are relying on the exemption provided by Rule 506(b) of Regulation D and Section 4(a) of the Securities Act in connection with our Private Offering.

We are conducting our continuous Multi-Class Offering of our Class S shares, Class D shares, and Class I shares, in a maximum aggregate amount of $300,000,000. Because the Multi-Class Offering is a “best efforts” offering, the Dealer Manager is only required to use its best efforts to sell the shares, which means that no underwriter, broker or other person will be obligated to purchase any shares.

We may borrow funds to make investments at any time, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of our offering, to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities, or if our Board of Directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. We have not yet decided, however, whether, and to what extent, we will finance portfolio investments using debt. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred stock.

The North American Securities Administrators Association, in its Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy adopted on March 29, 1992 and as amended on May 7, 2007 and from time to time, requires that our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate financial net worth, exclusive of home, automobile and home furnishings, of 5% of the first $20,000,000 of both the gross amount of securities currently being offered and the gross amount of any originally issued direct participation program sold by our sponsor and its affiliates within the last 12 months, plus 1% of all amounts in excess of the first $20,000,000. Based on these requirements, our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate net worth in excess of those amounts required by the Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy. 

For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our operating activities (used) provided $(27,411,792), $17,149,447 and $338,085 of cash, respectively. The change is primarily driven by an increase in purchases, an increase in a payable for open trades and for accrued legal and administrator fees, an increase in the amortization of deferred financing costs and an increase in due to administrator. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, operating activities included the purchases of 

investments of $48,266,763, $0 and $(13,696,250), respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, operating activities included the repayments and sales of portfolio investments of $7,966,315, $12,219,301 and $13,141,266, respectively. Financing activities (used) provided $37,025,657, $(12,824,459) and $(2,010,446) of cash during the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which included dividend payments of $(538,291), $(616,122) and $(736,412) respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repaid $24,800,000, $11,900,000 and $500,000, respectively, under the Credit Facility. 

Credit Facility

On May 16, 2019, the Company established a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with Royal Bank of Canada, a Canadian chartered bank, acting as administrative agent. In connection with the Credit Facility, TP Flexible Funding, LLC (the "SPV"), as borrower, and each of the other parties thereto entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2019 (the "Loan Agreement").

The Credit Facility had a maturity of May 21, 2029 and, initially, bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%. On May 11, 2020, in connection with an extension of the ramp period for the Credit Facility from May 15, 2020 to November 15, 2020, the Company agreed to the increased interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% on the Credit Facility for the period from May 16, 2020 through November 15, 2020. Effective November 10, 2020, the end date of the ramp period of the Credit Facility was extended again, from November 15, 2020 to May 14, 2021. As a result, the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility of the three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% was extended through May 14, 2021. On May 11, 2021, the end date of the ramp period of the Credit Facility was further extended from May 14, 2021 to November 15, 2021. As a result, the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility of the three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% was extended through November 15, 2021. On August 26, 2021, the end date of the ramp period of the Credit Facility was further extended from November 15, 2021 to August 25, 2022. In exchange, the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility of the three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% was extended permanently. On July 6, 2022, the end date of the ramp period of the Credit Facility was further extended from August 25, 2022 to August 25, 2023. In connection with such extension, the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility was amended from three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% to SOFR plus 2.20%. On March 24, 2023, (i) the end date of the ramp period of the Credit Facility was further extended from August 25, 2023 to October 25, 2023 and (ii) the Loan Agreement was amended to require sales of collateral and/or receipt of capital contributions in a combined amount to have generated proceeds (on a trade date basis) (x) during the period from March 24, 2023 through April 30, 2023, in the Initial Amount (the "Initial Amount") of $4,000,000, and (y) during each month thereafter in an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the "Required Amount") with any amount in excess of the total Required Amount plus the Initial Amount contributing to the Required Amount for the next month. In connection with such extension and amendment, the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility was reduced from SOFR plus 2.20% to SOFR plus 1.55%. The Credit Facility was secured by substantially all of the SPV’s properties and assets. Under the Loan Agreement, the SPV made certain customary representations and warranties and was required to comply with various covenants, including reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Loan Agreement included usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. On November 7, 2022, Royal Bank of Canada granted a waiver of any non-compliance with certain waterfall provisions in the Loan Agreement that may have occurred prior to November 7, 2022. Further non-compliance with certain waterfall provisions was permitted through January 31, 2023.

On September 21, 2023, the Company entered into the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, by and among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and SMBC, as administrative agent. In conjunction with the closing of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, we terminated the Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, there was a $27,800,000 balance on the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. 

As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we had $0 and $8,600,000, respectively, outstanding on our Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the investments used as collateral for the Credit Facility had an aggregate fair value of $0 and $16,278,891, respectively, which represents 0% and 74% of our total investments for each period, respectively. These securities are not available as collateral to the Company's general creditors. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, cash balances of $0 and $61,833, respectively, were used as collateral for the Credit Facility. 

In connection with the origination of the Credit Facility, we incurred $636,342 in fees, all of which were amortized over the term of the facility. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, $0 and $230,022, respectively, remains to be amortized and is reflected as deferred financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

During the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $264,524, $1,258,907 and $648,025, respectively, of interest costs and amortization of financing costs on the Credit Facility as interest expense. During the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we realized a loss on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of $66,844, $0 and $0, respectively.

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and certain agreed upon foreign currencies in an initial aggregate amount of up to $20,000,000 with an option for the Company to request, at one or more times, that existing and/or new lenders, at their election, provide up to $150,000,000 in aggregate. The Senior Secured Revolving 

Credit Facility provides for swingline loans in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not exceed $5,000,000. On January 30, 2024, the Company entered into the first amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Among other changes, the First Amendment amends the original Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility to provide for an increase in the aggregate commitment from $20,000,000 to $65,000,000. On February 1, 2024, there was an automatic commitment increase which increased the aggregate commitment from $65,000,000 to $75,000,000. Availability under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on the earlier of the commitment termination date ("Commitment Termination Date") of September 19, 2025 or the date of termination of the revolving commitments thereunder, and the outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will mature on September 21, 2026. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility also requires mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain events, including after the date of termination of the revolving commitments thereunder from asset sales, extraordinary receipts, returns of capital, equity issuances, and occurrence of indebtedness, with certain exceptions and minimum amount thresholds.

Borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are subject to compliance with a borrowing base test. Amounts drawn under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in U.S. dollars will bear interest at either term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus 2.5%, or the prime rate plus 1.5%. The Company may elect either the term SOFR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans denominated in U.S. dollars may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Company’s option, subject to certain conditions. Amounts drawn under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in other permitted currencies will bear interest at the relevant rate specified therein plus 2.5%.

During the period commencing on September 21, 2023 and ending on the earlier of the Commitment Termination Date or the date of termination of the revolving commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, the Company will pay a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum (based on the immediately preceding quarter’s average usage) on the daily unused amount of the commitments then available thereunder.

In connection with the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has made certain representations and warranties and must comply with various covenants and reporting requirements customary for facilities of this type. In addition, the Company must comply with the following financial covenants with respect to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries: (a) the Company must maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity, measured as of each fiscal quarter end; and (b) the Company must maintain at all times an asset coverage ratio not less than 150%.

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility contains events of default customary for facilities of this type. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the administrative agent, at the request of the required lenders, may terminate the commitments and declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility immediately due and payable.

The Company’s obligations under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Prospect Flexible Funding, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, and will be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company that are formed or acquired by the Company in the future. The Company’s obligations under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries thereunder.

During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company entered into the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, we had $27,800,000 outstanding on our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, the investments used as collateral for the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility had an aggregate fair value of $59,455,010, which represents 100% of our total investments for the period. As of June 30, 2024, cash balances of $5,417,977 were used as collateral for the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. The fair value of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility was $27,800,000 and is categorized as Level 2 under ASC 820 (as defined herein) as of June 30, 2024. The fair value of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is equal to its carrying value as the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is repriced to a market rate of interest frequently. 

In connection with the origination of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, we incurred $1,186,520 in fees, all of which are being amortized over the term of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, $910,312 remains to be amortized and is reflected as deferred financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 

During the year ended June 30, 2024, we recorded $979,148 of interest costs and amortization of financing costs on the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as interest expense.

The total cash retained during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as a result of issuing shares through our distribution reinvestment plan prior to this tender offer was approximately $102,413. The tender offer was for cash at a price equal to the net asset value per share as of July 31, 2024. The offer had been originally scheduled to expire at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on July 30, 2024. On August 5, 2024, the company amended the tender offer and extended the expiration date of the offer until 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on Friday, August 30, 2024, unless further extended. 

Distributions 

On July 25, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a distribution for the month of July 2024, which reflected a targeted annualized distribution rate of 7.50% based on the net asset value per share for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024. The distribution had a monthly record date as of the close of business of the last Friday in July 2024 and equaled a weekly amount of $0.00681 per share of common stock. The distribution was paid to stockholders of record as of the monthly record date set forth below.

On August 27, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a distribution for the month of August 2024, which reflected a targeted annualized distribution rate of 8.00% based on the net asset value per share for the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024. The distribution had a monthly record date as of the close of business of the last Friday in August 2024 and equaled a weekly amount of $0.00730 per share of common stock. The distribution was paid to stockholders of record as of the monthly record date set forth below.

Distributions

General

We elected to be treated, beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we generally must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (i) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our recognized capital gains in excess of recognized capital losses for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income or capital gains recognized but not distributed in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax.

While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may retain sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains such that we may be unable to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that event, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax imposed at corporate rates on any retained income, and we will also be liable for the U.S. federal excise tax but only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.

Our Board of Directors has authorized, and has declared, cash distributions on our common stock on a monthly basis since the second quarter of 2015 (in our capacity as TPIC). The amount of each such distribution is subject to our Board of Directors’ discretion and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. We calculate each stockholder’s specific distribution amount for the month using record and declaration dates, and distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock. From time to time, we may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Each year a statement on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV (or any successor form) identifying the source of the distribution (i.e., (i) paid from investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital gains, (ii) paid from net capital gain on the sale of securities, which is our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net-short term capital losses, and/or (iii) a return of paid-in capital surplus, which is generally a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to our stockholders. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from our offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes.

We have adopted an "opt in" distribution reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, when we make a distribution, stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically "opt in" to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to U.S. stockholders.

Related Party Transactions 

License Agreement

We entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of our Adviser, pursuant to which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the "Prospect" name. Under this license agreement, we have the right to use such name for so long as our Adviser or another affiliate of the Adviser is our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the "Prospect" name or logo. 

Investment Advisory Agreement 

We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser, pursuant to which we would pay our Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. Under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, we reduced the base management fee from an annual rate of 1.75% to 1.20% and eliminated the incentive fee payable thereunder, effective as of January 1, 2022 and until the one-year anniversary of the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange (the "Listing Anniversary"). Until such January 1, 2022 effective date, the advisory fees payable to the Adviser were as set forth in the Investment Advisory Agreement. The cost of any advisory fees payable to the Adviser will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. See "-Investment Advisory Fees." 

Certain members of our senior management hold an equity interest in our Adviser. Members of our senior management also serve as principals of other investment managers affiliated with our Adviser that do and may in the future manage investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles with investment objectives similar to ours.

Administration Agreement

Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, as amended and restated, between TPIC and PWAY, the Administrator, an affiliate of the Adviser, became the administrator for the Company pursuant to an administrative agreement, as amended and 

restated as of June 17, 2019 (the "Administration Agreement").The Administrator performs, oversees and arranges for the performance of administrative services necessary for the operation of the Company. These services include, but are not limited to, accounting, finance and legal services. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses the Administrator for the Company’s actual and allocable portion of expenses and overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the Company’s allocable portion of the costs of its Chief Financial Officer and CCO and her staff. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, allocation of overhead from the Administrator to the Company was $946,720, $568,825 and $671,707, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, $1,766,942 and $868,634, respectively, was payable to the Administrator US Bank, SMBC and BNY by the Company.

Co-Investments

On January 13, 2020, (amended on August 2, 2022), the parent company of the Adviser received the Order, which superseded a prior co-investment exemptive order granted on February 10, 2014, granting the ability to negotiate terms other than price and quantity of co-investment transactions with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain affiliates, including Prospect Capital Corporation ("PSEC") and Priority Income Fund, Inc. ("PRIS"), where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions included therein. 

Under the terms of the relief permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates, a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company’s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company’s stockholders and is consistent with the Company’s investment objective and strategies. In certain situations where co-investment with one or more funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer, the personnel of the Adviser or its affiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, when relying on the Order, the Company will be unable to invest in any issuer in which one or more funds managed or owned by the Adviser or its affiliates has previously invested. 

Officers and Directors

Certain officers and directors of the Company are also officers and directors of the Adviser and its affiliates. There were no fees paid to the independent directors of the Company as the Company did not exceed the minimum net asset value required (i.e., greater than $100 million) to receive a fee for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The officers do not receive any direct compensation from the Company. 

Dealer Manager Agreement 

On May 13, 2024, the Company entered into the dealer manager agreement (“Dealer Manager Agreement”) with the Dealer Manager.

Pursuant to the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Company pays the Dealer Manager over time a shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee with respect to our outstanding Class S and Class D shares equal to 0.85% and 0.25%, respectively, per annum of the aggregate NAV of our outstanding Class S and Class D shares, including any Class S and Class D shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, which is included in the 10% underwriting compensation limit as discussed in “Item 1. Business – Compensation of the Dealer Manager and Selected Broker-Dealers.” The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears. The Dealer Manager reallows (pays) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such participating brokers.

Our Adviser or an affiliate may also pay directly, or reimburse the Dealer Manager if the Dealer Manager pays on our behalf, any organization and offering expenses (other than any underwriting compensation, including upfront selling commissions and shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, subject to FINRA Rule 2310). Additionally, our Adviser will pay the Dealer Manager a distribution services fee of 0.848% of the sales price of each share sold, except for sales arranged by our Adviser, an affiliate of our Adviser, or their respective personnel. 

Expense Limitation Agreement

The Company entered into an expense limitation agreement, dated March 31, 2019 (the "Former ELA"), with PFIM, which was terminated effective February 17, 2021 in accordance with its terms. Amounts waived pursuant to the Former ELA ceased being eligible for repayment after September 30, 2023. On and effective April 20, 2021, the Company entered into a new expense limitation agreement with the Adviser, which was amended and restated on July 7, 2021 to extend the period during 

which the Adviser will be required to waive its investment advisory fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement, from September 30, 2021 to June 30, 2022 (the "First Amended and Restated ELA"). On August 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Expense Limitation Agreement (the "Second Amended and Restated ELA") to extend the period during which the Adviser will be required to waive its investment advisory fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement from June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022. On April 24, 2023, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Expense Limitation Agreement (the "Third Amended and Restated ELA" to extend the period during which the Adviser will be required to waive its investment advisory fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2024. On May 13, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Expense Limitation Agreement (the "Fourth Amended and Restated ELA" and, together with the First Amended and Restated ELA, the Second Amended and Restated ELA, and the Third Amended and Restated ELA, the "ELA") to extend the period during which the Adviser will be required to waive its investment advisory fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement from June 30, 2024 to December 31, 2024, as discussed below. Other than this change, the terms and conditions of the Fourth Amended and Restated ELA are identical to those of the First Amended and Restated ELA, the Second Amended and Restated ELA, and the Third Amended and Restated ELA. The ELA has an initial term ending on December 31, 2024 and may be continued thereafter for successive one-year periods in accordance with its terms. Pursuant to the terms of each expense limitation agreement the applicable investment adviser, in its sole discretion, could waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it was entitled to receive under its investment advisory agreement with the Company in order to limit the Company's operating expenses to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of the Company's average quarterly net assets, equal to 8.00%. In addition, under the ELA, the Adviser has agreed to waive its investment advisory fees to the extent necessary to limit the Company's operating expenses to such annual rate from the effective date of the ELA through December 31, 2024. 

Expense Limitation Agreement 

Expense Limitation Agreement with the Adviser

Pursuant to the ELA, our Adviser will waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it is entitled to receive pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, from the effective date of the ELA through December 31, 2024, in order to limit our Operating Expenses (as defined below) to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of our average quarterly net assets, equal to 8.00% (the "Annual Limit"). After December 31, 2024, such waiver may be made at our Adviser’s option and in its sole discretion. Even if the Adviser decides to voluntarily waive its investment advisory fees for a quarter ended after December 31, 2024, there is no guarantee that the Adviser will continue to do so. For purposes of the ELA, the term "Operating Expenses" with respect to the Company, is defined to include all expenses necessary or appropriate for the operation of the Company, including but not limited to our Adviser’s base management fee, any and all costs and expenses that qualify as line item "organization and offering" expenses in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as the same are filed with the SEC and other expenses described in the Investment Advisory Agreement, but does not include any portfolio transaction or other investment-related costs (including brokerage commissions, dealer and underwriter spreads, prime broker fees and expenses and dividend expenses related to short sales), interest expenses and other financing costs, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses. Upfront shareholder transaction expenses (such as sales commissions, dealer manager fees, and similar expenses) are not Operating Expenses. Our Adviser waived fees, pursuant to the ELA, in an amount of $447,554, $422,681 and $611,137 for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Any amount waived pursuant to the ELA is subject to repayment to our Adviser (an "ELA Reimbursement") by us within the three years of the date on which the waiver was made by our Adviser. If the ELA is terminated or expires pursuant to its terms, our Adviser will maintain its right to repayment for any waiver it has made under the ELA, subject to the Repayment Limitations (discussed below).

Any ELA Reimbursement can be made solely in the event that we have sufficient excess cash on hand at the time of any proposed ELA Reimbursement and shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the excess of the Annual Limit applicable to such quarter over the Company’s actual Operating Expenses for such quarter and (ii) the amount of ELA Reimbursement which, when added to the Company’s expenses for such quarter, permits the Company to pay the then-current aggregate quarterly distribution to its shareholders, at a minimum annualized rate of at least 6.00% (based on the gross offering prices of Company shares) (the "Distribution") from the sum of (x) the Company’s net investment income (loss) for such quarter plus (y) the Company’s net realized gains (losses) for such quarter (collectively, the "Repayment Limitations"). For the purposes of the calculations pursuant to (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, any ELA Reimbursement will be treated as an expense of the Company for such quarter, without regard to the GAAP treatment of such expense. In the event that the Company is unable to make a full payment of any ELA Reimbursements due for any applicable quarter because the Company does not have sufficient excess cash on hand, any such unpaid amount shall become a payable of the Company for accounting purposes and shall be paid when the Company has sufficient cash on hand (subject to the Repayment Limitations); provided, that in the case of any ELA Reimbursements, such payment shall be made no later than the date that is three years after the date on which the applicable waiver was made by our Adviser.

Investment Advisory Fees

Overview

On April 20, 2021, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, which was unanimously approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, including by all of the directors who are not "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act), on February 18, 2021, subject to stockholder approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Company’s stockholders approved the Investment Advisory Agreement at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on March 31, 2021.

The Investment Advisory Agreement replaced the Former Investment Advisory Agreement with PFIM, the Company's former investment adviser, which terminated effective April 20, 2021. The Investment Advisory Agreement is identical in all material respects to the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, except for its date of effectiveness, term and the Adviser serving as the Company’s investment adviser instead of PFIM. As such, the Former Investment Advisory Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement contain the same terms, provisions, conditions and fee rates, and provide for the same management services to be conducted by the Adviser as were conducted by PFIM. 

On November 5, 2021, we amended and restated the Investment Advisory Agreement to reduce the base management fee and eliminate the incentive fee payable to the Adviser thereunder, effective as of January 1, 2022 and until the one year anniversary of the listing of the Company’s common stock on a national securities exchange. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by our Board of Directors, including all of our directors who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act), on June 14, 2024.

The Investment Advisory Agreement, as amended and restated, is further discussed below.

Investment Advisory Agreement

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we paid the Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Adviser and any incentive fees it earns is ultimately borne by our stockholders. See "Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement" below for additional information.

Base Management Fee. The base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% quarterly) of our average total assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes. For the first quarter of our operations following the date of Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee was calculated based on the average value of our total assets as of the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement and at the end of the calendar quarter in which the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement fell, and was appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Subsequently, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our total assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter is appropriately pro-rated. At the Adviser’s option, the base management fee for any period may be deferred, without interest thereon, and paid to the Adviser at any time subsequent to any such deferral as the Adviser determines.

Incentive Fee. The incentive fee consisted of two parts: the subordinated incentive fee on income and the capital gains incentive fee.

Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our "pre-incentive fee net investment income" for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For purposes of this fee, "pre-incentive fee net investment income" means interest income, dividend income and distribution cash flows from equity investments and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses reimbursed under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the organization and offering expenses and incentive fees on income and capital gains). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly fixed preferred return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, of 1.5% (6.0% annualized), subject to a "catch up" feature. Operating expenses are included in the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income.

We will pay our Adviser a subordinated incentive fee on income for each calendar quarter as follows:

• No incentive fee will be payable to our Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.5%.

• 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875%) as the "catch-up." The effect of the "catch-up" provision is that, if our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 1.875% in any calendar quarter, our Adviser will receive 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return did not apply.

• 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized) will be payable to our Adviser. This reflects that once the preferred return is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20.0% of all pre-incentive fee net investment income thereafter will be allocated to our Adviser.

Capital Gains Incentive Fee. The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00% of our realized capital gains for the calendar year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at the end of such year; provided that the incentive fee determined as of December 31, 2021 will be calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any net realized capital gains, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for the period commencing as of the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement and ending on December 31, 2021. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser, we calculate the aggregate realized capital gains, aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, as applicable, with respect to each investment that has been in our portfolio. For the purpose of this calculation, an "investment" is defined as the total of all rights and claims which may be asserted against a portfolio company arising from our participation in the debt, equity, and other financial instruments issued by that company. Aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equal the sum of the differences between the aggregate net sales price of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate realized capital losses equal the sum of the amounts by which the aggregate net sales price of each investment is less than the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the differences, if negative, between the aggregate valuation of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment as of the applicable calendar year-end. At the end of the applicable calendar year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee involves netting aggregate realized capital gains against aggregate realized capital losses on a since-inception basis and then reducing this amount by the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation. If this number is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee payable is equal to 20.00% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid since inception. Operating expenses are not taken into account when determining capital gains incentive fees.

Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement

On November 5, 2021, we amended and restated the Investment Advisory Agreement to reduce the base management fee from an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% quarterly) to 1.20% (0.30% quarterly) and eliminate the incentive fee payable thereunder, effective as of January 1, 2022 and until the Listing Anniversary. 

Following the Listing Anniversary the base management fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% quarterly), commencing with the first base management fee calculation that occurs after such anniversary, and the Adviser will be entitled to receive the same incentive fee, including the subordinated incentive fee on income and the capital gains incentive fee, as set forth in the Investment Advisory Agreement and discussed above, commencing with the first calendar quarter after such anniversary. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement became effective on January 1, 2022. Until such effective date, the advisory fees payable to the Adviser were as set forth in the Investment Advisory Agreement. See "Investment Advisory Agreement" above.

During the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total base management fee incurred by the Adviser was $447,554, $422,681 and $611,137, respectively, which were waived by the Adviser. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the total base management fee due to the Adviser after the waiver was $0 and $0, respectively. 

There were no incentive fees payable as of June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2023. During the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no incentive fees incurred.

Asset Coverage

In accordance with the 1940 Act, the Company is currently only allowed to borrow amounts such that its "asset coverage," as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. "Asset coverage" generally refers to a company’s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by "senior securities," as defined in the 1940 Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. "Senior securities" for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock. 

On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum "asset coverage" ratio from 200% to 150%, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. In addition, for BDCs like the Company whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is also required to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares at the rate of 25% per quarter over four calendar quarters. Under the existing 200% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company is permitted to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity, and under the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company will be permitted to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. In other words, Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended, permits BDCs to potentially increase their debt-to-equity ratio from a maximum of 1 to 1 to a maximum of 2 to 1.

At the 2019 Annual Meeting, stockholders approved the application to the Company of the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act. As a result, and subject to certain additional disclosure requirements and the repurchase obligations described above, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of March 16, 2019. 

Below is our annual asset coverage since June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio stood at 213% based on the outstanding principal amount of our senior securities representing indebtedness.

Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. These estimates, however, are subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ materially from our current estimates due to the inherent nature of these estimates.

Our critical accounting estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with our risk factors as disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on how fair value of our investment portfolio is determined, and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the inputs and assumptions used to measure fair value of our investment portfolio. 

Fair value of Financial Instruments

To value our investments, we follow the guidance of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ("ASC 820"), that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with GAAP, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted.

ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:

Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 

Level 2. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.

Level 3. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. All of our investments carried at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, with a significant portion of our investments classified as Level 3.

Investments

We determine the fair value of our investments on a quarterly basis, with changes in fair value reflected as a net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The Company applies the SEC’s Rule 2a-5 in determining fair value of its investments. Rule 2a-5 establishes a consistent, 

principles-based framework for boards of directors to use in creating their own specific processes in order to determine fair values in good faith.

Investments for which market quotations are readily available must be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not readily available, we perform a multiple step valuation process with our investment professionals alongside our independent valuation firms. The independent valuation firms prepare valuations for each investment which are presented by the independent valuation firms to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the value for each investment and the Board of Directors approves the values with the input of the Adviser quarterly. For intra-quarter valuations, the Adviser as valuation designee takes the most recent quarterly valuations approved by the Board of Directors, calculates the estimated earnings per share for each investment in order to adjust the valuation of each investment for income that is expected to be realized and considers other factors that should be taken into account in order to adjust the valuations, including, market changes in expected returns for similar investments; performance improvement or deterioration which would change the margin added to the base interest rate charged; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the issuer’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow; the markets in which the issuer does business; comparisons to publicly traded securities; and other relevant factors.

Management and the independent valuation firm may consider various factors in determining the fair value of our investments. One prominent factor is the enterprise value of a portfolio company determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. If relevant, management and the independent valuation firms will consider the pricing indicated by external events such as a purchase or sale transaction to corroborate the valuation.

Changes in market yields, discount rates, capitalization rates or EBITDA multiples, each in isolation, may change the fair value measurement of certain of our investments. Generally, an increase in market yields, discount rates or capitalization rates, or a decrease in EBITDA (or other) multiples may result in a decrease in the fair value measurement of certain of our investments.

Our investments that are classified as Level 3 are primarily valued utilizing a discounted cash flow, enterprise value ("EV") waterfall, or asset recovery analysis. The discounted cash flow converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. Under the EV waterfall, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company’s securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., "waterfall" allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow. The asset recovery analysis is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company’s assets.

In determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. Various risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment.

At June 30, 2024, $38,732,046, $2,768,603, $17,954,361, and $0 of our total investments were valued using the discounted cash flow, enterprise value waterfall, market quotes and sensitivity analysis, respectively, compared to $18,808,075, $478,096, $0 and $499,544, respectively, at June 30, 2023.

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the currently assigned valuations.
