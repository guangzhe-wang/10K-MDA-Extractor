Item 6. [Reserved]

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Fund Overview

The Fund is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Manager and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Fund holds Fund Components and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of Fund Components. As a passive investment vehicle, the Fund’s investment objective is for the value of the Shares to reflect the value of the Fund Components, determined by reference to their respective Digital Asset Reference Rates and weightings within the Fund, less the Fund’s expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in the Fund Components, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to the digital assets held by the Fund. To date, the Fund has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of the digital assets held by the Fund, less the Fund’s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. The Fund is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. As of June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Fund had unlimited Shares authorized of 15,867,400 Shares issued and outstanding.

Includes the total number of Shares that are not restricted securities as such term is defined under Rule 144.

Includes Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC for the Shares traded on OTCQX, but not its direct participants. Therefore, this number does not include the individual holders who have bought/sold Shares on OTCQX or transferred their eligible Shares to their brokerage accounts. 

Effective July 1, 2022, the Manager adopted the DLCS Methodology. In connection with the adoption of the DLCS Methodology, the Manager changed the Digital Asset Reference Rates used to value the Fund Components and as of the date of this Annual Report, each of the Digital Asset Reference Rates are Indicative Prices. Prior to the adoption of the DLCS Methodology, the Fund determined which Fund Components to hold pursuant to the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology and the Digital Asset Reference Rates used to value the Fund Components were Index Prices or an Old Indicative Price. See “Item 1. Business—Investment Objective” and “Item 1. Business—Valuation of Digital Assets and Determination of NAV” for additional information.

Any references to the Digital Asset Reference Rates subsequent to July 1, 2022 are to the Digital Asset Reference Rates in effect following the adoption of the DLCS Methodology. Any references in this section to the Digital Reference Rates prior to July 1, 2022 are to the Digital Asset Reference Rates in effect prior to the adoption of the DLCS Methodology. All references to the NAV and NAV per Share of the Fund for periods subsequent to July 1, 2022 in this Annual Report have been calculated based on the digital assets held by the Fund pursuant to the DLCS Methodology and the corresponding rebalancing of the Fund on July 5, 2022. All references to the NAV and NAV per Share of the Fund for periods prior to July 1, 2022 have been calculated based on the digital assets held by the Fund pursuant to the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology prior to the adoption of the DLCS Methodology and the corresponding rebalancing of the Fund on July 5, 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition

The Fund considers investment transactions to be the receipt of Fund Components for Share creations and the delivery of Fund Components for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in Fund Components. At this time, the Fund is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Fund records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Manager’s Fee in the Fund Components.

Principal Market and Fair Value Determination

To determine which market is the Fund’s principal market for each Fund Component (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Fund’s net asset value in accordance with U.S. GAAP (“Principal Market NAV”), the Fund follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for each Fund Component in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Fund to assume that each Fund Component is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.

The Fund only receives Fund Components in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or a Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Fund looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider, may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets (referred to as “Trading Platform Markets” in this Annual Report), each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, “Digital Asset Markets”).

In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Fund’s principal market for each Fund Component, the Fund reviews these criteria in the following order:

•

First, the Fund reviews a list of each Digital Asset Market that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering (“AML”) and know-your-customer (“KYC”) regulations, and non-Digital Asset Trading Platform Markets that the Fund reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. 

•

Second, the Fund sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of each Fund Component traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months. 

•

Third, the Fund then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. 

•

Fourth, the Fund then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market for such Fund Component based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Fund, Trading Platform Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the Fund Components. The Fund therefore looks to accessible Trading Platform Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market for each Fund Component. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, a Trading Platform Market has been selected as the Fund’s principal market for each Fund Component. 

The Fund determines its principal market for each Fund Component (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market’s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Fund has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market’s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Fund’s determination of its principal market for each Fund Component.

The cost basis of each Fund Component received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Fund at the fair value of such Fund Component at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Fund may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors.

Investment Company Considerations

The Fund is an investment company for GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services—Investment Companies. The Fund uses fair value as its method of accounting for digital assets in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Fund is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.

Review of Financial Results

Financial Highlights for the Years Ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022

(All amounts in the following table and the subsequent paragraphs, except Share, per Share amounts, and each Fund Component and price of each Fund Component, are in thousands)

Net assets in the above table and subsequent paragraphs are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP based on the Digital Asset Market price of each Fund Component on the Digital Asset Trading Platforms that the Fund considered each Fund Component’s principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date.

Net realized and unrealized gain on investments in digital assets for the year ended June 30, 2024 was $264,196, which includes a realized gain of $6,714 on the transfer of digital assets to pay the Manager’s Fee, a realized gain of $789 as a result of the quarterly rebalance of digital assets, and net change in unrealized appreciation on investments in digital assets of $256,693.

Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was ($194,391) for the year ended June 30, 2022, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investments in digital assets, plus the Manager’s Fee of $11,214. Net assets decreased to $173,852 at June 30, 2022, a 53% decrease for the year. The decrease in net assets resulted from the price depreciation of Fund Components for the year and the withdrawal of approximately 166 Bitcoin, 1,015 Ether, 282,861 ADA, 2,007 SOL, 1,962 DOT, 532 AVAX, 606 LTC, 4,091 UNI, 4,042 LINK, and 172 BCH to pay the foregoing Manager’s Fee, partially offset by the contribution of approximately 13 Bitcoin, 77 Ether, 20,953 ADA, 47 LTC, 310 LINK, and 13 BCH with a total value of $935 to the Fund, in connection with Share creations.

Cash Resources and Liquidity

The Fund has not had a cash balance at any time since inception. When selling Fund Components and/or Forked Assets to pay Additional Fund Expenses on behalf of the Fund, the Manager endeavors to sell the exact amount of Fund Components and/or Forked Assets needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Fund’s holdings of assets other than the Fund Components. As a consequence, the Manager expects that the Fund will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Fund is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.

In exchange for the Manager’s Fee, the Manager has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Fund. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Fund during the periods covered by this Annual Report was the Manager’s Fee. The Fund is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.

Selected Operating Data

As a result, the NAV per Share for periods subsequent to July 1, 2022 are not directly comparable to the NAV per Share as of June 30, 2022. See “Item 1. Business—Investment Objective” and “Item 1. Business—Valuation of Digital Assets and Determination of NAV” for additional information.

For accounting purposes, the Fund reflects creations and the Fund Components receivable with respect to such creations on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation but does not issue Shares until the requisite amount of Fund Components is received. At this time, the Fund is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Manager in its sole discretion, the Fund may in the future operate a redemption program. The Fund currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program.

Historical Fund Component Prices

As movements in the price of each Fund Component will directly affect the price of the Shares, investors should understand recent movements in the price of each Fund Component. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in each of the Fund Component prices are not indicators of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world.
