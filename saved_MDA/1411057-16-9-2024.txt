.| Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
---|--- 

The financial information discussed below is derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements at May 31, 2024, which were prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This financial information is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes contained herein, which more fully present the Company’s financial condition and results of operations at that date. The results set forth in these consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the Company’s future performance. This item and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in forward-looking statements.

Information about the Company

The Company, headquartered in Houston, Texas, conducts clinical trials for Sponsors and CROs and as a Sponsor through Alpha Research Institute and cannabis-related education in classrooms, seminars and online through Pharmacology University. For detailed information about the Company and its operations, see “Business.”

The Company’s fiscal year begins on June 1 in each year and ends on May 31 in the following year.

Going Concern

As indicated in Note 3 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2024, and the report thereon of the Company’s independent auditing firm, there is substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred recurring losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities and has an accumulated deficit, and its ability to continue as a going concern depends on the successful execution of its operating plan, which includes increasing sales of existing services and introducing new services, as well as raising either debt or equity financing.

The Company needs substantial additional capital to fund its business, including the completion of its business plan and repayment of its debts. No assurance can be given that any additional capital can be obtained or, if obtained, will be adequate to meet its needs, and the Company may need to take measures to remain a going concern. If adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and satisfactory terms, the Company’s operations could be materially negatively impacted, or it could be forced to terminate its operations.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the Company and its financial results in different ways, depending on the particular business operation, as follows:

Pharmacology University Business. The Company encountered quarantines, restrictions on gatherings and other governmental regulations that precluded classroom education, as well as restrictions on travel that reduced consulting activities. The Company reduced the impact of the pandemic by developing online educational programs and transitioning its workforce to a remote working environment without reducing its workforce. Revenue from this operation was increased from $18,323 in the year ended May 31, 2019 (unaudited), to $44,799 and $38,440 in the years ended May 31, 2020, and May 31, 2021, respectively; revenue for the year ended May 31, 2022, was $18,341, for May 31, 2023, was $42,655 and for the year ended May 31, 2024, was $36,335.

Clinical Trials. Quarantines, restrictions on gatherings and other governmental regulations, amplified by potential patients’ fears of contracting COVID-19 at the Company’s clinics, negatively affected clinical trials. In addition, these clinics were subject to closure if cases of the virus were detected. Revenue from this operation changed from $165,666 in the year ended May 31, 2019 (unaudited), to $84,979 and $706,008 in the years ended May 31, 2020, and May 31, 2021, respectively; revenue for the year ended May 31, 2022, was $196,637, for the year ended May 31, 2023, was $266,280 and for the year ended May 31, 2024, was $213,865.

The Company believes that, although the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the Company’s operations and, especially with respect to its Pharmacology University business, and caused the Company to change the way in which it operates today, it is no longer affected by the pandemic.

Change of Corporate Name

The Company believes that it may have been negatively impacted by the association of the pandemic with the People’s Republic of China because “China” appeared in its former corporate name. Although the Company has no operations in or any relationship with China, the Company believes that potential investors may have been deterred from considering the Company because of concerns related to that country. For this reason, and because the Company’s corporate name did not reflect its activities, it changed its name to Cannabis Bioscience International Holdings, Inc. on December 6, 2022.

Overview

The Company provides educational systems focused on medical cannabis in the United States and Latin America, as well as worldwide through online education and services in therapeutic areas of clinical trials. The Company’s operating units and their activities were:

The Company operated a Sleep Center, which diagnosed sleep-related disorders. Its operations were terminated on April 30, 2023.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Year Ended May 31, 2024, and the Year Ended May 31, 2023

The following table sets forth information from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended May 31, 2024, and May 31, 2023.

Revenues

Revenues were $248,841 and $316,825 for the years ended May 31, 2024, and May 31, 2023, respectively, primarily due to a decrease of $52,415 in revenues from clinical trial contracts, which were $266,280 in the earlier period and $213,865 in the later. Revenues from cannabis-related educational classes and seminars were $6,335 for the year ended May 31, 2024, as compared with $42,655 for the year ended May 31, 2023, because the Company conducted fewer classes and seminars in the year ended May 31, 2024. Consulting fees were $28,641 for the year ended May 31, 2024, versus $8,333 for the year ended May 31, 2023.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the years ended May 31, 2024, and May 31, 2023, consisted of the following:

The decrease in contract labor was due to a substantial reduction in staff to write, translate, and produce audiobooks, e-books, and online videos. Professional fees decreased by $7,735 because the Company’s legal and accounting costs decreased after the Company’s registration statement became effective on December 6, 2023. Officer compensation decreased because an officer left the Company and was not replaced. Rent increased by $14,788 because rent for the Company’s premises increased when the lease was renewed.

Operating Loss

For the reasons set forth above, operating loss decreased from $983,371 in the year ended May 31, 2023, to $486,140 in the year ended May 31, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At May 31, 2024, the Company had $755 in cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable of $20,139, negative working capital of $860,416 and no commitments for capital expenditures. At May 31, 2023, the Company had $8,913 in cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable of $10,549, negative working capital of $366,085 and no commitments for capital expenditures. The Company had cash in the amount of $1,028 on September 10, 2024.

During the years ended May 31, 2024, and May 31, 2023, the Company had net cash used in operations of $479,382 and $898,367, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities of $471,224 and $875,298, respectively. The Company had accumulated deficits of $5,334,081 at May 31, 2024, and $4,682,736 at May 31, 2023.

Delays in payments by Sponsors and CROs that have affected, and if they were to recur, could affect, the Company’s cash flows.

Since June 1, 2022, the Company has raised capital as follows:

The Company has offered 6,250,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the public at an offering price of $0.0008 per share (the “Offering”). If the Offering had been fully sold, the Company would have raised new capital of $5,000,000. However, as of the date of this Report, no shares have been sold and the Company believes that it will not be able to sell any of these shares until the market price for its Common Stock exceeds the public offering price of the Offering for a substantial period. As a result, the Company believes that it will be able to raise equity capital only through the sale of shares of Common Stock in private transactions at discounts from the market price for Common Stock, which may be substantial. The Company believes that, for the time being, it will not be able to attain the goals described under “Business Plan” in the prospectus for the public offering and that it will need to obtain funding for the $2,425,000 required to attain these goals and its estimated that other capital needs of $2,000.000 (including operating costs of $600,000, legal/accounting costs of $400,000, overhead of $800,000 and a reserve for contingencies of $200,000 for the next two years) through revenue from operations, profits, private sales of its equity securities, loans or a public offering at a lower offering price that for the Offering.

There is no assurance that such funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all or that the Company will attain profitability. If the Company cannot raise sufficient funds when required or on acceptable terms, it may have to reduce its operations significantly or discontinue them entirely. To the extent that funds are raised by issuing equity securities or securities that are convertible into the Company’s equity securities, its stockholders may experience significant dilution. If the Company is successful in raising funds for its business plan and in carrying it out, it expects to become profitable in the year ending May 31, 2025, and beyond.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Smaller Growth Company

Climate Change

The Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations have not been materially impacted by federal and state legislation and regulation and international accords regarding climate change, but it cannot predict how they may be impacted in the future. The Company has had no material past capital expenditures for climate-related projects and, unless there are regulatory changes, does not expect to incur them in the future.

Long-Term Obligations

The Company has no long-term obligation that it expects to have a material impact on its liquidity or capital resources.
