Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

General

Our profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets, principally loans, investment securities, and interest-earning deposits in other institutions, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. Net interest income is dependent upon the level of interest rates and the extent to which such rates are changing. Our profitability also depends, to a lesser extent, on non-interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest expenses, and federal income taxes. Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana had net income of $3.6 million in fiscal 2024 compared to net income of $5.7 million in fiscal 2023.

Our business consists primarily of originating single-family real estate loans secured by property in our market area and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and real estate secured lines of credit which typically have higher rates and shorter terms than single-family loans. Although our loans are primarily funded by the acquisition of deposits and it is our policy to require commercial customers to have a deposit relationship with us, which primarily consists of NOW accounts or non-interest checking accounts. Due to the continued low interest rate environment, we have sold a substantial amount of our fixed rate single-family residential loan originations in recent periods. Because of an increase in our average rate on our interest-bearing assets, partially offset by an increase in our rate on total interest bearing liabilities, our net interest margin decreased from 3.73% to 3.08% during fiscal 2024 compared to 2023, and our net interest income decreased $2.6 million to $19.0 million for fiscal 2024 as compared to $21.6 million for fiscal 2023. We expect to continue to emphasize commercial lending in the future in order to improve the yield on our portfolio.

Home Federal Bancorp’s operations and profitability are subject to changes in interest rates, applicable statutes and regulations, and general economic conditions, as well as other factors beyond our control.

Business Strategy

Our business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community-oriented financial institution. Our current business strategy includes:

Critical Accounting Policies

In reviewing and understanding financial information for Home Federal Bancorp, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.

During the year ended June 30, 2024, we implemented new current expected credit loss accounting policies, procedures, and controls as part of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 and subsequent ASUs issued to amend ASC Topic 326.

Allowance for Credit Losses. We have identified the calculation of the allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting policy, due to the higher degree of judgment and complexity than our other significant accounting policies.

Business Combinations. Acquisition Accounting. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company as the acquirer to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as recognize goodwill. If the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in an acquisition, goodwill is recognized. The Company records provisional amounts of fair value at the time of acquisition. The provisional fair values are subject to modification for up to one year after the acquisition.

Acquired Loans. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, acquired loans are segregated between those purchased with credit deterioration (“PCD”) and those that are not (“non-PCD”). Loans considered PCD include those individual loans (or groups of loans with similar risk characteristics) that as of the date of acquisition are assessed as having experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. The assessment of what is more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination considers information including, but not limited to, financial assets that are delinquent, on nonaccrual and/or otherwise adversely risk rated as of the acquisition date, those that have been downgraded since origination, and those for which, after origination, credit spreads have widened beyond the threshold specified in policy. The Company bifurcates the fair value discount between the credit and noncredit components and records an allowance for credit losses for PCD loans by adding the credit portion of the fair value discount to the initial amortized cost basis and increasing the allowance for credit losses at the date of acquisition. Any noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring loans with credit deterioration is allocated to each individual asset. All non-PCD loans acquired are recorded at the estimated fair value of the loan at acquisition, with the estimated allowance for credit loss recorded as a provision for credit losses through earnings in the period in which the acquisition has occurred. The noncredit discount or premium for PCD loans and full discount for non-PCD loans will be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate at the acquisition date.

Under the transition provisions of ASU 2016-13, the Company classified all purchased credit impaired loans (“PCI”) previously accounted for under Financial Accounting Standard Subtopic 310-30 to be classified as PCD, without reassessing whether the financial assets meet the criteria of PCD as of the date of adoption. The application of these provisions resulted in an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to reflect the addition of the allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption. The Company elected not to maintain pools of loans accounted for under Subtopic 310-30 at adoption. The Company was also not required to reassess whether modifications to individual acquired financial assets accounted for in pools were troubled debt restructurings as of the date of adoption. The noncredit discount, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, is accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined at the adoption date.

Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

Core Deposit Intangible. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in business combinations. The Company’s policy is to amortize these intangibles on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful life, which the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. Core deposit intangibles are tested for impairment if events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows.

Selected Financial and Other Data 

Set forth below is selected consolidated financial and other data of Home Federal Bancorp. The information at or for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is derived in part from the audited financial statements that appear in this Form 10-K.

Changes in Financial Condition

Total assets decreased $23.4 million, or 3.5%, from $660.9 million at June 30, 2023 to $637.5 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in assets was comprised of decreases in net loans receivable of $18.6 million, or 3.8%, from $489.5 million at June 30, 2023 to $470.9 million at June 30, 2024, investment securities of $18.0 million, or 15.8%, from $114.0 million at June 30, 2023 to $96.0 million at June 30, 2024, core deposit intangible of $334,000, or 21.8%, from $1.5 million at June 30, 2023 to $1.2 million at June 30, 2024, deferred tax asset of $132,000, or 10.1%, from $1.3 million at June 30, 2023 to $1.2 million at June 30, 2024, other assets of $74,000, or 5.2%, from $1.4 million at June 30, 2023 to $1.3 million at June 30, 2024, accrued interest receivable of $15,000, or 0.8%, from $1.8 million at June 30, 2023 to $1.78 million at June 30, 2024, and partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents of $10.2 million, or 41.1%, from $24.8 million at June 30, 2023 to $34.9 million at June 30, 2024, loans-held-for-sale of $1.7 million, from $4,000 at June 30, 2023 to $1.7 million at June 30, 2024, premises and equipment of $1.7 million, or 10.5%, from $16.6 million at June 30, 2023 to $18.3 million at June 30, 2024, bank owned life insurance of $110,000, or 1.6%, from $6.7 million at June 30, 2023 to $6.8 million at June 30, 2024, and real estate owned of $50,000, or 13.6% from $368,000 at June 30, 2023 to $418,000 at June 30, 2024. The decrease in investment securities was primarily due to $17.7 million in principal payments. The increase in cash and cash equivalents from $24.8 million at June 30, 2023 to $34.9 million at June 30, 2024 was mainly due to decreases in loans receivable and investment securities.

Loans receivable, net decreased $18.6 million, or 3.8%, from $489.5 million at June 30, 2023 to $470.9 million at June 30, 2024. In recent periods we diversified the loan products we offer and increased our efforts to originate higher yielding commercial real estate loans and lines of credit and commercial business loans which were deemed attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2024, Home Federal Bank had $143.5 million of commercial real estate loans, 30.2% of the total loan portfolio, and $49.3 million of commercial business loans, 10.4% of the total loan portfolio. Although commercial loans are generally considered to have greater credit risk than other certain types of loans, we attempt to mitigate such risk by originating such loans in our market area to known borrowers.

Cash and cash equivalents increased $10.2 million, or 41.1%, from $24.8 million at June 30, 2023 to $34.9 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to decreases in loans receivable and investment securities.

Securities available-for-sale decreased $12.6 million, or 31.6%, from $39.6 million at June 30, 2023 to $27.0 million at June 30, 2024. This decrease resulted primarily from purchases of $2.7 million in securities, partially offset by principal repayments of $12.1 million.

Securities held-to-maturity decreased $5.6 million, or 7.7%, from $72.9 million at June 30, 2023 to $67.3 million at June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to principal repayments of $5.6 million.

Total liabilities decreased $25.7 million, or 4.2%, from $610.4 million at June 30, 2023 to $584.7 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in liabilities was comprised of decreases in total deposits of $23.4 million, or 3.9%, from $597.4 million at June 30, 2023 to $574.0 million at June 30, 2024, other borrowings of $1.6 million, or 18.1%, from $8.6 million at June 30, 2023 to $7.0 million at June 30, 2024, other accrued expenses and liabilities of $727,000, or 18.6%, from $3.9 million at June 30, 2023 to $3.2 million at June 30, 2024, and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance of $33,000, or 6.0%, from $554,000 at June 30, 2023 to $521,000 at June 30, 2024,. The decrease in deposits resulted from decreases in money market deposits of $28.7 million, or 25.1%, from $114.2 million at June 30, 2023 to $85.5 million at June 30, 2024, non-interest bearing deposits of $15.2 million, or 10.5%, from $145.6 million at June 30, 2023 to $130.3 million at June 30, 2024, and savings deposits of $5.3 million, or 6.4%, from $81.9 million at June 30, 2023 to $76.6 million at June 30, 2024, partially offset by increases in certificates of deposit of $24.5 million, or 12.9%, from $190.4 million at June 30, 2023 to $214.9 million at June 30, 2024, and NOW accounts of $1.3 million, or 2.0%, from $65.3 million at June 30, 2023 to $66.6 million at June 30, 2024. The Company had no balances in brokered deposits at June 30, 2024 compared to $3.0 million at June 30, 2023. There was a shift of balances between deposit categories due to customers moving funds from lower yielding categories to higher yielding categories.

Shareholders’ equity increased $2.3 million, or 4.5%, from $50.5 million at June 30, 2023 to $52.8 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in shareholders’ equity was comprised of current year net income of $3.6 million, the vesting of restricted stock awards, stock options, and the release of employee stock ownership plan shares totaling $500,000, proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options of $373,000, and a decrease in the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive loss of $39,000, partially offset by dividends paid totaling $1.6 million, stock repurchases of $487,000, and CECL implementation totaling $189,000.

Average Balances, Net Interest Income Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Tax-exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. All average balances are based on monthly balances. Management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be.

Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected Home Federal Bancorp’s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by current year volume), and (iii) total change in rate and volume. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023

General. The decrease in net income for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, resulted from a decrease in net interest income of $2.6 million, or 12.1%, a decrease in non-interest income of $515,000, or 24.5%, and an increase in non-interest expense of $413,000, or 2.6%, partially offset by a decrease in the provision of credit losses of $828,000, or 95.4%, and a decrease in provision for income taxes of $590,000, or 55.3%. The decrease in net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, resulted from an increase in total interest expense of $7.8 million, or 154.2%, partially offset by an increase in total interest income of $5.2 million, or 19.7%. The increase in total interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a $7.5 million, or 166.3% increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to an $87.5 million, or 69.4%, increase in average balance of certificates of deposit, combined with a 181 basis point increase in rate paid on certificates of deposit for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. The Company’s average interest rate spread was 2.38% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.37% for the year ended June 30, 2023. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.08% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.73% for the year ended June 30, 2023.

Net Interest Income. Net interest income amounted to $19.0 million for fiscal year 2024, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 12.1%, compared to $21.6 million for fiscal year 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from an increase in total interest expense of $7.8 million, partially offset by an increase in total interest income of $5.2 million.

The average interest rate spread decreased from 3.37% for fiscal 2023 to 2.38% for fiscal 2024, while the average balance of interest-earning assets increased from $577.8 million to $614.3 million during the same periods. The percentage of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 133.54% for fiscal 2024 compared to 141.05% for fiscal 2023. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased from 2.34% for fiscal 2023 to 4.15% for fiscal 2024. Net interest margin decreased to 3.08% for fiscal 2024 compared to 3.73% for fiscal 2023.

Interest income increased $5.2 million, or 19.7%, to $31.9 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $26.6 million for fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of $5.6 million, and an increase of $400,000 in interest income from investment securities. The increase in the average balance of loans receivable was primarily due to new loans originated by our commercial lending division. The average yield of the loan portfolio increased by 51 basis points during fiscal 2024 mainly due to a higher interest rate environment.

Interest expense increased $7.8 million, or 154.2%, to $12.9 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $5.1 million for fiscal 2023, primarily as a result of increases in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits.

Provision for Credit Losses. On July 1, 2023, we adopted the new current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology for estimating credit losses. This resulted in a $189,000 increase to the allowance for credit losses and a one-time cumulative adjustment resulted in a $189,000 decrease to stockholders’ equity. For purchased credit deteriorated loans, we applied the guidance under CECL using the prospective transition approach. As a result, we adjusted the amortized cost basis of the purchased credit deteriorated loans by $170,000 to reclassify the purchase discount to the allowance for credit losses on July 1, 2023. The allowance for credit losses account increased $359,000 from these two transactions. No provision expense was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a recovery of credit losses of $16,000 was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, a provision of $11,000 was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and a provision of $45,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $4.6 million, and the ratio of allowance for credit losses to gross loans was 0.96%. As of June 30, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was $5.2 million, and the ratio of allowance for credit losses to gross loans was 1.05%.

At June 30, 2024, the Company had $1.9 million of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, and other real estate owned) compared to $1.6 million on non-performing assets at June 30, 2023, consisting of three commercial non-real estate loans, five single-family residential loans, four home equity line-of-credit loans, and three single-family residences in other real estate owned at June 30, 2024, compared to seven single-family residential loans, two commercial non-real estate loans, one consumer loan and two single-family residences in other real estate owned at June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2024 the Company had five commercial non-real-estate loans, six single family residential loans, four home-equity line-of-credit loans, and one auto loan classified as substandard, compared to ten single family residential loans, three commercial non-real-estate loans, two commercial real estate loans, and three home equity line-of-credit loans classified as substandard at June 30, 2023. There were no loans classified as doubtful at June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2023.

Non-Interest Income. The $515,000 decrease in non-interest income for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, resulted from an increase in loss on sale of real estate of $415,000, a decrease in gain on sale of loans of $201,000, and a decrease in gain on sale of fixed assets of $4,000, partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $48,000, an increase in gain on sale of securities of $26,000, an increase in other non-interest income of $24,000, and an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of $7,000. The decrease in gain on sale of loans for the year ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage loan originations caused by the higher interest rate environment. The loss on sale of real estate for the year ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to the bulk sale of twenty-one distressed rental properties in December 2023.

Non-Interest Expense. The $413,000 increase in non-interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, resulted from increases in compensation and benefits expense of $436,000, audit and examination fees of $235,000, amortization of core deposit intangible expense of $160,000, franchise and bank shares tax expense of $125,000, other non-interest expense of $125,000, occupancy and equipment expense of $122,000, deposit insurance premium expense of $96,000, and advertising expense of $20,000, partially offset by decreases in professional fees of $676,000, data processing expense of $187,000, and loan and collection expense of $43,000. The decrease in professional fees for the year ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to the acquisition of First National Bank of Benton, which increased professional fees for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increases in compensation and benefits expense were primarily due to additional branch and back office staff.

Provision for Income Tax Expense. The provision for income taxes amounted to $476,000 and $1.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 11.7% for fiscal 2024 and 15.7% for fiscal 2023.

Exposure to Changes in Interest Rates

Our ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily of securities available-for-sale and long-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, which have fixed rates of interest. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest rise.

We have maintained a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities during the past few years in order to better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment in the long term. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, securities available-for-sale amounted to $27.0 million and $39.6 million, respectively, or 4.24% and 6.04%, respectively, of total assets at such dates.

Quantitative Analysis. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency provides a quarterly report on the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of portfolio equity. Management reviews the quarterly reports from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which show the impact of changing interest rates on net portfolio value. Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts.

Net Portfolio Value. Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in our net portfolio value (“NPV”) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of June 30, 2024:

Qualitative Analysis. Our ability to maintain a positive “spread” between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is affected by changes in interest rates. Our fixed-rate loans generally are profitable, if interest rates are stable or declining since these loans have yields that exceed our cost of funds. If interest rates increase, however, we would have to pay more on our deposits and new borrowings, which would adversely affect our interest rate spread. In order to counter the potential effects of dramatic increases in market rates of interest, we have underwritten our mortgage loans to allow for their sale in the secondary market. Total loan originations amounted to $209.9 million for fiscal 2024 and $244.0 million for fiscal 2023, while loans sold amounted to $16.0 million and $24.9 million during the same respective periods. We have invested excess funds from loan payments and prepayments and loan sales in investment securities classified as available-for-sale. As a result, Home Federal Bancorp is not as susceptible to rising interest rates as it would be if its interest-earning assets were primarily comprised of long-term fixed rate mortgage loans. With respect to its floating or adjustable rate loans, Home Federal Bancorp writes interest rate floors and caps into such loan documents. Interest rate floors limit our interest rate risk by limiting potential decreases in the interest yield on an adjustable rate loan to a certain level. As a result, we receive a minimum yield even if rates decline farther, and the interest rate on the particular loan would otherwise adjust to a lower amount. Conversely, interest rate ceilings limit the amount by which the yield on an adjustable rate loan may increase to no more than six percentage points over the rate at the time of origination. Finally, we intend to place a greater emphasis on shorter-term consumer loans and commercial business loans in the future.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Home Federal Bancorp maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. Our liquidity ratio averaged 20.4% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.

Our primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales and earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Our deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to $185,000 and $5.0 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

A significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which provide an additional source of funds. At June 30, 2024, we had no advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and had $186.4 million in additional borrowing capacity. Additionally, at June 30, 2024, Home Federal Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank, whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed $20.4 million. There were no amounts purchased under this agreement as of June 30, 2024. In addition, Home Federal Bancorp had available an $11.0 million line of credit agreement at June 30, 2024 with First National Bankers Bank, maturing on August 29, 2024. At June 30, 2024 there was a $7.0 million balance in the credit line.

At June 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding loan commitments of $38.3 million to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit of $14.8 million. At June 30, 2024, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $185.6 million, or 86.4% of total certificates of deposit. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment. We intend to utilize our high levels of liquidity to fund our lending activities. If additional funds are required to fund lending activities, we intend to sell our securities classified as available-for-sale, as needed.

At June 30, 2024, Home Federal Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with common equity tier 1, tier 1 capital, total capital, leverage, and tangible capital ratios of 13.29%, 13.29%, 14.35%, 8.99%, and 8.99%, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and have not had any such arrangements during the two years ended June 30, 2024. See Notes 9 and 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein regarding Home Federal Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on Home Federal Bancorp’s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the beliefs, expectations or opinions of Home Federal Bancorp and its management regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as: “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional terms such as “will”, “would”, “should”, “could”, “may”, “likely”, “probably”, or “possibly.” Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions; statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services; and statements regarding future performance. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumption, many of which are difficult to predict and generally are beyond the control of Home Federal Bancorp and its management, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: economic and competitive conditions which could affect the volume of loan originations, deposit flows and real estate values; the levels of non-interest income and expense and the amount of loan losses; competitive pressure among depository institutions increasing significantly; changes in the interest rate environment causing reduced interest margins; general economic conditions, either nationally or in the markets in which Home Federal Bancorp is or will be doing business, being less favorable than expected political and social unrest including acts of war or terrorism; or legislation or changes in regulatory requirements adversely affecting the business in which Home Federal Bancorp will be engaged. Home Federal Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.
