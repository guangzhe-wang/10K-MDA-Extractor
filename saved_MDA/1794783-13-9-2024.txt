ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A above.

Company Overview

SelectQuote, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “SelectQuote”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”) is a leading technology-enabled, direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) distribution and engagement platform for selling insurance policies and healthcare services. Our insurance distribution business, which has operated continuously for nearly 40 years, allows consumers to transparently and conveniently shop for senior health, life, and automobile and home insurance policies from a curated panel of the nation’s leading insurance carriers. As an insurance distributor, we do not insure the consumer, but rather identify consumers looking to acquire insurance products and place these consumers with insurance carrier partners that provide these products. In return, we earn commissions from our insurance carrier partners for the policies we sell on their behalf. Our proprietary technology allows us to take a broad funnel approach to marketing by analyzing and identifying high-quality consumer leads sourced from a wide variety of online and offline marketing channels including digital marketing, radio, television, and third-party marketing partners. We monitor our acquisition costs to dynamically allocate our marketing spend to the most attractive channels, benefiting from nearly 40 years of data accumulated through our proprietary, purpose-built technologies. Our advanced workflow processing system scores each acquired lead in real time, matching it with a sales agent whom we determine is best suited to meet the consumer’s need. Our platform then captures and utilizes our experience to further build upon the millions of data points that feed our marketing algorithms, further enhancing our ability to deploy subsequent marketing dollars efficiently and target more high-quality consumer leads. We have built our business model to maximize commissions collected over the life of an approved policy, a metric we refer to as “ lifetime value of commissions” or “LTV”, which is a key component to our overall profitability.

Our proprietary routing and workflow system is a key competitive advantage and driver of our business performance. Our systems analyze and intelligently route consumer leads to agents and allow us to monitor, segment, and enhance our agents’ performance. This technological advantage also allows us to rapidly conduct a needs-based, tailored analysis for each consumer that maximizes sales, enhances customer retention, and ultimately maximizes LTV’s. Our expertise and value add stems from the coupling of our technology with our skilled agents, which provides greater transparency in pricing terms and choice and an overall better consumer experience. When customers are satisfied, their propensity to switch policies decreases, thereby improving retention rates (“persistency”), increasing LTV’s and, ultimately, optimizing our financial performance and shareholder value.

SelectQuote has a long history of successful DTC product distribution and consumer engagement, and we bring this same capability to healthcare services. We saw a large opportunity to leverage our existing customer base and distribution model to improve education and access to healthcare services for our senior consumers and to create value for our shareholders and insurance carrier partners. SelectQuote’s value lies in our ability to engage the consumer, capture critical self-reported information in real-time, and then take action on that information to offer each consumer personalized solutions. Our healthcare services business seeks to provide consumers with a wide breadth of products supporting their needs, such as SelectRx, our Patient-Centered Pharmacy HomeTM (“PCPH”) accredited pharmacy, which has already demonstrated SelectQuote’s ability to leverage our strong consumer engagement to drive immediate value using our existing operational infrastructure. Whether through acquisitions or new partnerships, we continue to look for more opportunities to leverage our strengths to expand our healthcare services business. 

We evaluate our business using the following four segments:

Senior was launched in 2010 and provides unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage (“MA”) and Medicare Supplement (“MS”) insurance plans as well as prescription drug and dental, vision, and hearing (“DVH”) plans, and critical illness products. We represent approximately 25 leading, nationally-recognized insurance carrier partners, including UHC, Humana, Aetna, and Wellcare. MA and MS plans accounted for 91%, 89%, and 82% of our approved Senior policies for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, with other ancillary type policies accounting for the remainder.

Healthcare Services, launched in 2021, offers various health-related products and services through SelectRx, Population Health, and most recently, SelectPatient Management. SelectRx offers essential prescription medications, OTC medications, customized medication packaging, and medication therapy management, providing long-term pharmacy care that enables patients to optimize medication adherence to drive positive health outcomes, while enabling patients managing polypharmacy and multiple chronic conditions to remain at home. Through Population Health, we utilize our excellent consumer engagement capabilities to capture valuable self-reported information in real-time for our insurance carrier partners by completing Health Risk Assessments (“HRAs”). We then use that data to take a real-time, proactive, and personalized approach to offer various health-related products and services to the consumer, such as our pharmacy services from SelectRx. In 2024, we launched SelectPatient Management (“SPM”), via a $4.0 million acquisition of an existing chronic care management platform, which offers providers, payers, and Accountable Care Organizations scalable, technology-enhanced services for patients living with chronic conditions. Through consistent, trust-based patient engagement, SPM helps patients navigate the care continuum, focusing on non-clinical factors so physicians can focus on the more critical needs of their patients. We believe that offering these services enables healthcare to be more accessible, convenient, and personalized for our members.

Life is one of the country’s largest and most established DTC insurance distributors for term life insurance, having sold over 2.2 million policies nationwide since our founding in 1985. Our platform provides unbiased comparison shopping for life insurance products such as term life, final expense, and other ancillary products like critical illness, accidental death, and juvenile insurance. We represent approximately 20 leading, nationally-recognized insurance carrier partners, with many of these relationships exceeding 15 years. Term life policies accounted for 45%, 47%, and 36% of new premium within the Life segment for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, with final expense policies accounting for 55%, 53%, and 64% for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Auto & Home was launched in 2011 as an unbiased comparison shopping platform for auto, home, and specialty insurance lines. Our platform provides unbiased comparison shopping for insurance products such as homeowners, auto, dwelling fire, and other ancillary insurance products underwritten by approximately 25 leading, nationally recognized insurance carrier partners. Homeowners and 12-month auto products accounted for 74%, of new premium within the Auto & Home segment for years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 76% for the year ended June 30, 2022, with six-month auto, dwelling fire, and other products accounting for a majority of the remainder.

Industry Trends

We estimate that the total addressable market for the insurance products we distribute is greater than $180 billion. Further, while these markets are already substantial, they are also growing, in part due to a number of highly attractive demographic trends. 

Our Senior and Healthcare Services segments serve consumers predominantly in the over 65 age category. According to the United States Census Bureau, the over 65 age category grew from 13% of the total population in 2010 to 17% of the total population in 2020, and is expected to reach 21% in 2030. On average, 11,000 “Baby Boomers” are expected to turn 65 every day or nearly 4.2 million per year through the end of the decade. As a result, Medicare enrollment is growing steadily, with the number of Medicare enrollees expected to grow from 63 million 

in 2021 (up from 59 million in 2018), to approximately 75 million in 2030, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June 2023. Of this, Medicare Advantage plans are representing an increasing share of the Medicare market. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2023, Medicare Advantage surpassed 50% market penetration, with nearly 31 million Medicare Advantage enrollees. Medicare Advantage enrollment as a share of the eligible Medicare population has grown from 19% in 2007 to 51% in 2023 and is projected to grow to 62% by 2033. The degree to which we will realize a corresponding increase in revenue will be determined by our ability to continue to successfully place new Medicare policies for this enlarged potential consumer base. 

The U.S. life insurance market is mature and has experienced annual premium growth of 2.9% since 2013, according to S&P Global. Growth in the life insurance sector is driven by a number of macro-economic factors including population growth, general economic growth and individual wealth accumulation. 

The auto insurance industry has grown at an annual rate of 5.3% from 2013—2021 based on Statutory Direct Premiums Written, according to S&P Global, with 2021 written premium totaling $261 billion. Industry growth is driven by growth in the number of registered vehicles, increases in insurance premium rates and general economic growth. The homeowners insurance industry has grown at an annual rate of 4.9% from 2013—2021 based on Statutory Direct Premiums Written, according to S&P Global, with 2021 written premium totaling $120 billion. Industry growth is driven by growth in housing supply, increases in insurance premium rates and general economic growth. 

Technological innovations are changing the insurance distribution landscape. As the composition of the U.S. population gradually shifts to the mobile-first generation, consumers are becoming more tech-savvy and comfortable shopping online. According to J.D. Power, 90% of customers say they are open to purchasing their auto insurance online. We believe our proprietary technology platform, vast datasets and use of machine learning in all aspects of our business put us in an excellent position to take advantage of these consumer trends. 

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

Our primary source of revenue is commissions revenue from selling policies in the senior health, life, and auto and home markets on behalf of our insurance carrier partners, the majority of which compensate us through first year and renewal commissions. We use our proprietary technology and processes to generate and obtain consumer leads and allocate those leads to agents who are best suited for those consumers. As a result, one of the primary factors affecting our growth is our total number of agents. We view agents as a critical component of helping consumers through the purchasing process to enable them to identify the most appropriate coverage that suits their needs. Through our years of experience, we have expanded and tailored our recruiting efforts and enhanced our training programs, both of which have allowed us to expand our agent force when necessary. We have also developed proprietary technologies and processes that enable us to expand our lead acquisition efforts to keep pace with our expanding sales force and maintain agent productivity.

The amount of revenue we expect to recognize per policy is based on multiple factors, including our commission rates with our insurance carrier partners and the expected retention rates of different types of policies. The higher our retention rates, the more revenue we expect to generate pursuant to our carrier agreements, which generally entitle us to receive annual renewal commissions for so long as the policyholder renews their policy. Our goal is to maximize lifetime value by increasing retention rates, which starts by providing consumers with a transparent, valuable, and best-in-class consumer experience and making sure consumers are buying a policy that meets their specific needs.

Key Business and Operating Metrics by Segment

In addition to traditional financial metrics, we rely upon certain business and operating metrics to estimate and recognize revenue, evaluate our business performance, and facilitate our operations. In Senior, our primary product, Medicare Advantage, pays us flat commission rates based on the number of policies we sell on behalf of our insurance carrier partners. Therefore, we have determined that units and unit metrics are the most appropriate measures to evaluate the performance of Senior. For Healthcare Services, our primary source of revenue is 

pharmacy revenue from SelectRx, so the total number of SelectRx members and the prescriptions shipped per day are the most appropriate measures used to evaluate the performance of Healthcare Services as these metrics drive top-line revenue. In Life and Auto & Home, we are typically paid a commission that is a percent of the premium that we generate for our insurance carrier partners. Therefore, we have determined that premium-based metrics are the most relevant measures to evaluate the performance of these segments. Below are the most relevant business and operating metrics for each segment:

Senior

Submitted Policies

Submitted policies are counted when an individual completes an application with our licensed agent and provides authorization to them to submit it to the insurance carrier partner. The applicant may have additional actions to take before the application will be reviewed by the insurance carrier.

The following table shows the number of submitted policies for the years ended June 30:

2024 compared to 2023—Total submitted policies for all products increased 7% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. This was driven by increases in overall close rates (11%), the number of average productive agents (7%), and productivity per agent (9%).

2023 compared to 2022—Total submitted policies for all products decreased 25% for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, in line with our updated operating strategy to reduce the Senior distribution business and focus resources on Healthcare Services. The number of average productive agents decreased 55% during the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022; however, due to a higher mix of tenured agents and an increased focus on agent training and development, productivity per agent increased 25% and overall close rates increased 24%.

Approved Policies

Approved policies represents the number of submitted policies that were approved by our insurance carrier partners for the identified product during the indicated period. Not all approved policies will go in force.

The following table shows the number of approved policies for the years ended June 30:

In general, the relationship between submitted policies and approved policies has been steady over time. Therefore, factors impacting the number of submitted policies also impact the number of approved policies.

2024 compared to 2023—Total approved policies for all products increased by 6% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. Fluctuations in approved policies are normally in direct correlation to submitted policies; however, primarily due to carrier mix, we experienced a slight decrease in the submitted-to-approved conversion rates for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023.

2023 compared to 2022—Total approved policies for all products decreased by 20% for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, in line with our updated operating strategy to reduce the policy growth in our Senior distribution business and focus additional resources on growing members for Healthcare Services. Fluctuations in approved policies are normally in direct correlation to submitted policies; however, due to our increased focus on agent training and development and a higher mix of tenured agents, we experienced a 6% improvement in the submitted-to-approved conversion rates for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.

Lifetime Value of Commissions per Approved Policy

The LTV per approved policy represents commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of an approved policy based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix, and expected policy persistency with applied constraints. The LTV per approved policy is equal to the sum of the commission revenue due upon the initial sale of a policy, and when applicable, an estimate of future renewal commissions. The estimate of the future renewal commissions is determined using contracted renewal commission rates, which does not include marketing development funds or production bonuses, constrained by a persistency-adjusted 10-year renewal period based on a combination of our historical experience and available insurance carrier historical experience to estimate renewal revenue only to the extent probable that a significant reversal in revenue would not be expected to occur. These factors may result in varying values from period to period. The LTV per approved policy represents commissions only from policies sold during the period; it does not include any updated estimates of prior period variable consideration based on actual policy renewals in the current period.

The following table shows the LTV per approved policy for the years ended June 30:

2024 compared to 2023—The LTV per MA approved policy increased 4% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to carrier mix.

2023 compared to 2022—The LTV per MA approved policy decreased 5% for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The LTV per MA approved policy was negatively impacted by carrier mix and lower persistency rates, which includes a higher provision for renewal year lapse rates, somewhat offset by higher commission rates.

Healthcare Services

The total number of SelectRx members represents the amount of active customers to which an order has been shipped and the prescriptions per day represents the total average prescriptions shipped per business day. These two metrics are the primary drivers of revenue for Healthcare Services.

SelectRx Members

The following table shows the total number of SelectRx members as of June 30:

The total number of SelectRx members increased by 68% as of June 30, 2024, compared to June 30, 2023, due to our operating strategy to grow SelectRx.

Prescriptions Per Day

The following table shows the average prescriptions shipped per day for the years ended June 30:

Life

Life premium represents the total premium value for all policies that were approved by the relevant insurance carrier partner and for which the policy document was sent to the policyholder and payment information was received by the relevant insurance carrier partner during the indicated period. Because our commissions are earned based on a percentage of total premium, total premium volume for a given period is the key driver of revenue for Life.

The following table shows term and final expense premiums for the years ended June 30:

2024 compared to 2023—Total term premiums increased 2% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, due to a 5% increase in the average premium per policy sold, offset by a 3% decrease in the number of policies sold. Final expense premiums increased 11% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, due to a 3% increase in the average premium per policy sold and a 9% increase in the number of policies sold.

2023 compared to 2022—Total term premiums increased 11% for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, due to an 8% increase in the average premium per policy sold and a 3% increase in the number of policies sold. Final expense premiums decreased 29% for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The number of policies sold declined 36% driven by a lower average agent headcount, which was somewhat offset by a 12% increase in the average premium per policy sold.

Auto & Home

Auto & Home premium represents the total premium value of all new policies that were approved by our insurance carrier partners during the indicated period. Because our commissions are earned based on a percentage of total premium, total premium volume for a given period is the key driver of revenue for our Auto & Home segment.

The following table shows premiums for the years ended June 30:

2024 compared to 2023—Total premiums increased 11% for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, due to a 16% increase in the average premium per policy sold, offset by a 4% decrease in the number of policies sold.

2023 compared to 2022—Total premiums increased 2% for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, due to a 5% increase in the average premium per policy sold, offset by a 3% decrease in the number of policies sold.

Key Components of our Results of Operations

The following table sets forth our operating results and related percentage of total revenues for the years ended June 30: 

Revenue

We earn revenue in the form of commission payments from our insurance carrier customers, for the initial year the insurance policy is in effect (“first year”) and, where applicable, for each subsequent year the policy renews (“renewal year”), in addition to production bonuses and marketing development funds received from some insurance carriers. Production bonuses are based on attaining various predetermined target sales levels or other agreed upon objectives, whereas marketing development funds may or may not contain such predetermined targets and are used to purchase leads. These, along with other services revenue from Healthcare Services (excluding SelectRx revenue discussed below) and our lead generation business, InsideResponse (of which the majority is eliminated as intersegment revenue), are presented in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as commissions and other services revenue. Pharmacy revenue on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss includes revenue from the sale of prescription and OTC medication products from SelectRx.

Revenue is recognized at different milestones for Senior, Life, and Auto & Home and is based on the contractual enforceable rights, our historical experience, and established customer business practices. Other services revenues from our Healthcare Services segment (excluding SelectRx revenue discussed below) is recognized when the performance obligation has been met, which is at different times for our various services (e.g. the HRA has been performed, a transfer has been made to a health-related partner, or SPM has provided care management services to a member), the transaction price is known based on volume and contractual prices, and we have no further performance obligations. Lead generation revenue is recognized when the generated lead is accepted by our 

customers, which is the point of sale, and we have no performance obligation after the delivery. Revenues generated from SelectRx are recognized upon shipment. At the time of shipment, we have performed all of our performance obligations and control of the product has been transferred to the customer. There are no future revenue streams or variable consideration associated as the transaction price is fixed at time of shipment, and any subsequent new order is its own performance obligation.

The following table presents our revenue for the periods presented and the percentage changes from the prior year:

2024 compared to 2023—Commissions and other services revenue increased $93.6 million, or 12%, primarily due to increases in Senior, Life, and Auto & Home of $65.7 million, $12.1 million, and $14.4 million, respectively. Senior’s increase was primarily due to a $71.7 million increase in commissions revenue driven by a 6% increase in approved policies and a 6% increase in LTV’s. Life’s increase was driven by a $3.9 million increase in term revenue and a $7.7 million increase in final expense revenue. Pharmacy revenue increased $225.3 million, or 94%, due to the increase in members from the growth of the SelectRx business. 

2023 compared to 2022—Commissions and other services revenue increased $58.7 million, or 8%, primarily due to increases in Senior of $62.2 million, offset by decreases in Life and Auto & Home of $8.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively. For Senior, excluding the $193.3 million downward adjustment from a change in estimate of MA cohort transaction prices during the year ended June 30, 2022, commission revenue decreased $121.1 million, which was driven by a 20% decrease in approved policies and a 5% decrease in MA LTV’s, slightly offset by higher commission rates. Life’s revenue decline was primarily driven by an $11.8 million decrease in final expense revenue, partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in term revenue. Pharmacy revenue increased $180.1 million due to the increase in members from the growth of the SelectRx business.

Operating Costs and Expenses

Cost of Commissions and Other Services Revenue

Cost of commissions and other services revenue represents the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations to our customers in Senior, Life, Auto & Home, and Healthcare Services (excluding SelectRx discussed below); primarily compensation, benefits, and licensing for sales agents, customer success agents, fulfillment specialists, and others directly engaged in serving customers. It also includes allocations for facilities, telecommunications, and software maintenance costs, which are all based on headcount. Facilities costs include rent and utilities expenses and other costs to maintain our office locations. Telecommunications and software maintenance costs includes costs related to the internal phone systems and various software applications that our agents use to make sales. These costs directly correlate to the number of agents we have as we are primarily charged based on per person usage for the phone systems and software applications.

The following table presents our cost of commissions and other services revenue for the years ended June 30 and the percentage changes from the prior year: 

2024 compared to 2023—Cost of commissions and other service revenue increased $17.3 million, or 6%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an $18.2 million increase in compensation costs related to a $4.8 million increase in costs for our sales and customer care agents in Senior, a $4.4 million increase for Healthcare Services related to the growth of SelectRx, and a $6.4 million increase for Life related to compensation structure changes for our final expense sales agents. 

2023 compared to 2022—Cost of commissions and other service revenue decreased $90.0 million, or 23%, in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a $66.8 million decrease in compensation costs, a $13.0 million decrease in licensing costs, and a $10.5 million decrease in allocations for facilities, telecommunications, and software maintenance costs, all of which was due to the reduction in our agent headcount during the year ended June 30, 2023.

Cost of Goods Sold-Pharmacy Revenue

Cost of goods sold-pharmacy revenue represents the direct costs associated with fulfilling pharmacy patient orders for SelectRx. Such costs primarily consist of medication costs and compensation costs for licensed pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and other employees directly associated with fulfilling orders such as packaging and shipping clerks. It also includes shipping, supplies, other order fulfillment costs including part of the one-time customer onboarding costs, and certain facilities overhead costs such as rent, maintenance, and depreciation related to the pharmacy production process.

The following table presents our cost of goods sold-pharmacy revenue for the periods presented and the percentage change from the prior year: 

2024 compared to 2023–Cost of goods sold-pharmacy revenue increased $179.0 million, or 79%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $158.9 million increase in medication costs as the number of SelectRx members increased 68% over the prior year as well as a $11.0 million increase in compensation costs due to an increase in employees directly associated with fulfilling pharmacy orders.

2023 compared to 2022–Cost of goods sold-pharmacy revenue increased $161.8 million, or 252%, in 2023 compared to 2022, due to a $134.8 million increase in medication costs due to an increase in volumes as well as an increase in average medication costs, a $6.6 million increase in shipping and fulfillment costs, and a $15.3 million increase in compensation costs as the number of SelectRx members increased 92% over the prior year.

Marketing and Advertising

Marketing and advertising expenses consist primarily of the direct costs associated with marketing and advertising of our services, such as television and radio commercials and online advertising. These direct costs generally represent the vast majority of our marketing and advertising expenses. Other costs consist of compensation and other expenses related to marketing, business development, partner management, public relations, carrier relations personnel who support our offerings, and allocations for facilities, telecommunications, and software maintenance costs. Our marketing and advertising costs increase during AEP and OEP to generate more leads during these high-volume periods.

The following table presents our marketing and advertising expenses for the years ended June 30 and the percentage changes from the prior year:

2024 compared to 2023—Marketing and advertising expenses increased $57.6 million, or 19%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $50.7 million increase in lead costs and a $5.8 million increase in compensation costs for marketing personnel. This increase can be attributed to the increase in MA submitted policies and an increase in customer acquisition costs on a per policy basis.

2023 compared to 2022—Marketing and advertising expenses decreased $182.8 million, or 38%, in 2023 compared to 2022, due to a $173.9 million decrease in lead costs due to the decrease in volume associated with the Company’s updated operating strategy, as well as an $8.6 million decrease in compensation costs. However, there was an increase in marketing efficiency as our CAC per approved policy decreased due to improved agent close rates as a result of increased focus on agent training and development.

Selling, General, and Administrative

Selling, general, and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits costs for staff working in our executive, finance, accounting, recruiting, human resources, administrative, business intelligence, data science, and part of the SelectRx customer onboarding departments. These expenses also include fees paid for outside professional services, including audit, tax, and legal fees and allocations for facilities, telecommunications, and software maintenance costs.

The following table presents our selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30 and the percentage changes from the prior year:

2024 compared to 2023—Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $4.5 million, or 3%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an $11.2 million increase in compensation costs related to the growth of SelectRx, a $6.2 million increase for both financing transaction costs and SelectRx bad debt expense, offset by a $2.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization and a $17.3 million decrease in long-lived asset impairment expense.

2023 compared to 2022—Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $35.6 million, or 35%, in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an $18.9 million increase in compensation costs, mostly related to the expansion of SelectRx. Additionally, there was a $14.2 million increase in long-lived asset impairment expense, as described in Notes 3, 4, and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

Technical Development

Technical development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits costs for internal and external personnel associated with developing, maintaining and enhancing our applications, infrastructure and other IT-related functions as well as allocations for facilities, telecommunications and software maintenance costs.

The following table presents our technical development expenses for the years ended June 30 and the percentage changes from the prior year:

2024 compared to 2023—Technical development expenses increased $7.5 million, or 29%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $7.3 million increase in compensation costs due to an increase in headcount for technology personnel.

2023 compared to 2022—Technical development expenses increased $1.3 million, or 5%, in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in compensation costs related to our technology personnel.

Interest Expense, Net

The following table presents our interest expense, net for the years ended June 30 and the percentage changes from the prior year:

2024 compared to 2023—Interest expense increased $12.9 million, or 16%, in 2024 compared to 2023, as a result of higher interest rates during the period. The increase was partially offset by $2.6 million of interest received on our money market account during the period.

2023 compared to 2022—Interest expense increased $37.0 million, or 85%, in 2023 compared to 2022, as a result of interest incurred on the Term Loans due to additional principal outstanding, the amortization and write-off of additional deferred financing costs associated with Senior Secured Credit Facility amendments, as well as higher interest rates during the period. The increase was partially offset by $1.9 million of interest received on our money market account during the period.

Income Taxes

The following table presents our provision for income taxes for the years ended June 30 and the percentage changes from the prior year: 

2024 compared to 2023—Income tax expense (benefit) increased $15.7 million, or 148%, in 2024 compared to 2023. For the year ended June 30, 2024, we recognized an income tax expense of $5.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 17.4%. The differences from our federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate were primarily related to state income taxes and the recording of a valuation allowance for federal and state tax attributes that the Company does not expect to utilize prior to expiration. For the year ended June 30, 2023, we recognized an income tax benefit of $10.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 15.3%. The differences from our federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate were primarily related to state income taxes, RSU vestings, 

executive officer compensation, and the recording of a valuation allowance for state tax attributes that the Company does not expect to utilize prior to expiration.

2023 compared to 2022—Income tax benefit decreased $81.7 million, or 89%, in 2023 compared to 2022. For the year ended June 30, 2023, we recognized an income tax benefit of $10.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 15.3%. The differences from our federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate were primarily related to state income taxes, RSU vestings, executive officer compensation, and the recording of a valuation allowance for state tax attributes that the Company does not expect to utilize prior to expiration. For the year ended June 30, 2022, we recognized an income tax benefit of $92.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.7%, with the differences from our federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate primarily related to state income taxes.

Segment Information

The Company’s operating and reportable segments have been determined in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”). We currently have four reportable segments: i) Senior, ii) Healthcare Services, iii) Life, and iv) Auto & Home. Senior primarily sells senior Medicare-related health insurance products. Healthcare Services includes SelectRx, Population Health, and most recently, SelectPatient Management. Healthcare Services provides products and services to our Medicare policyholders, which are focused on improving patient health outcomes. Life primarily sells term life and final expense products, and Auto & Home primarily sells individual automobile and homeowners’ insurance. We have not aggregated any operating segments together to represent a reportable segment. 

Our operating segments are determined based on how our chief executive officer, who also serves as our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages our business, regularly accesses information, and evaluates performance for operating decision-making purposes, including allocation of resources. Adjusted EBITDA is our segment profit measure and a key measure used by our CODM and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate the operating performance of our business and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based and approved. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus: (i) interest expense, net; (ii) expense (benefit) for income taxes; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) share-based compensation; (v) goodwill, long-lived asset, and intangible assets impairments; (vi) transaction costs; (vii) loss on disposal of property, equipment, and software, net; and (viii) other non-recurring expenses and income.

Effective July 1, 2024, the Company will realign its reportable segments as a result of the change in strategic direction established for fiscal year 2025. This realignment will consist of removing the Auto & Home business as a reportable segment leaving three reportable segments. This change is a result of the Board of Directors electing to reduce revenue growth for the Auto & Home business, based on the current high rate environment for the industry, our limited resources, and our continued focus on positive cash flow, all of which are challenging us to evaluate resource allocations across the business. With the reduction in revenue growth, the Auto & Home business will no longer meet the quantitative thresholds to be required to continue to be separately disclosed as a reportable segment and therefore we will be included in Other beginning July 1, 2024. If the environment changes in the future, we will reevaluate the requirements around our reportable segments. The tables presented below have not been adjusted to reflect this change in reportable segments. All prior-period comparative segment information will be recast in the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2025 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect the change in reportable segments. 

The following tables present information about the reportable segments for the periods presented. We do not report total assets by segment as our CODM does not use this information to evaluate operating segment performance. Accordingly, we do not regularly provide such information by segment to our CODM.

Our segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which consist of affiliate marketing fees for services provided by our Senior segment to our Healthcare Services, Life and Auto & Home segments as well as services provided by Life and Auto & Home to other segments. These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that we believe approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties and, therefore, impact segment performance. However, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in 

consolidation. The elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within the “Elims” column in the tables below.

Adjusted EBITDA from Healthcare Services was $7.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, a $30.6 million increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $(22.8) million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was due to a $226.4 million increase in revenue, offset by a $195.8 million increase in operating costs and expenses primarily as a result of a $158.9 million increase in medication costs and a $8.0 million increase in fulfillment costs in support of the growth of SelectRx. 

Adjusted EBITDA from our Life segment was $20.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, a $2.9 million, or 13%, decrease compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due to a $15.0 million increase in operating costs and expenses primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in compensation costs and a $7.8 million increase in marketing and advertising costs. The decrease in operating costs and expenses was offset by a $12.1 million increase in revenue as discussed above.

Adjusted EBITDA from our Auto & Home segment was $14.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, a $14.0 million increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was due to a $14.4 million increase in revenue offset by a $0.3 million increase in operating costs and expenses due to a $1.3 million increase in compensation costs.

2023 compared to 2022—Adjusted EBITDA from our Senior segment was $155.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, a $316.8 million, or 196%, increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $(161.7) million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to a $62.2 million increase in revenue and a $254.6 million decrease in operating costs and expenses primarily due to a $157.1 million reduction in marketing and advertising costs, a $73.4 million reduction in compensation costs, and a $11.2 million reduction in licensing fees.

Adjusted EBITDA from Healthcare Services was $(22.8) million for the year ended June 30, 2023, a $9.3 million increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $(32.1) million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to a $182.0 million increase in revenue as discussed above, offset by a $172.7 million increase in operating 

costs and expenses primarily as a result of a $134.8 million increase in medication costs, a $27.0 million increase in compensation costs, and a $6.4 million increase in fulfillment costs, due to the growth of Healthcare Services. 

Adjusted EBITDA from our Life segment was $23.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, a $23.2 million, or 17986%, increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $(0.1) million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was due to a $31.3 million decrease in operating costs and expenses primarily due to a $26.8 million reduction in marketing and advertising costs and a $3.7 million reduction in compensation costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our liquidity needs primarily include working capital and debt service requirements. We believe that the cash available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months. Additionally, we are required under the Senior Secured Credit Facility to maintain compliance with certain debt covenants, as discussed further in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Based on our financial projections, we believe we will remain in compliance with the debt covenants through the 12 months following the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. 

We do not expect to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to repay all outstanding amounts under the Senior Secured Credit Facility at the time of its maturity on September 15, 2025. If we are unable to secure additional financing from outside sources or otherwise refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we will need to obtain additional capital through other means, including by selling one or more material assets or substantially reducing the scope of certain of our operations. If we are unable to satisfy our repayment obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or maintain compliance with the covenants therein, we may be in default, which would significantly affect our liquidity.

As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $42.7 million and $83.2 million, respectively. Additionally, the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the years ended June 30:

Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation; amortization of intangible assets and internally developed software; deferred income taxes; share-based compensation expense; impairment charges; and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.

Collection of commissions receivable depends upon the timing of our receipt of commission payments and associated commission statements from our insurance carrier partners. If we were to experience a delay in receiving 

a commission payment from an insurance carrier partner within a quarter, our operating cash flows for that quarter could be adversely impacted.

A significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses is driven by the number of leads required to generate the insurance applications we submit to our insurance carrier partners. Our marketing and advertising costs are expensed and generally paid as incurred and since commission revenue is recognized upon approval of a policy but commission payments are paid to us over time, there are working capital requirements to fund the upfront cost of acquiring new policies. During AEP, we experience an increase in the number of submitted Senior insurance applications and marketing and advertising expenses compared to periods outside of AEP. The timing of AEP affects the positive or negative impacts of our cash flows during each quarter.

Year Ended June 30, 2024—Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.2 million, consisting of net loss of $34.1 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $68.9 million, and cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $19.5 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $25.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $13.8 million of share-based compensation expense, $19.6 million of accrued interest payable in kind on the Term Loans, $6.1 million of amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount, $2.3 million of non-cash lease expense, and $1.2 million in deferred income taxes. The cash decrease resulting from changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an increase of $40.8 million in commissions receivable, due to a 6% increase in approved policies for the year, a decrease of $4.9 million of operating lease liabilities and an increase of $2.0 million in other assets, all partially offset by an increase of $7.3 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, related to an increase in revenue, an increase of $15.6 million in other liabilities, primarily related to an $6.4 million increase in our contract liability, and a $7.4 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits, related to our increased headcount, and a decrease of $5.2 million in accounts receivable, net, related to cash collections to date. 

Year Ended June 30, 2023—Net cash used in operating activities was $19.4 million, consisting of net loss of $58.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $71.7 million, and cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $32.5 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $27.9 million of depreciation and amortization, $17.3 million of charges for impairment of long-lived assets, $11.3 million of share-based compensation expense, $12.0 million of accrued interest payable in kind on the Term Loans, $8.7 million of amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount, and $4.2 million of non-cash lease expense, offset by $11.2 million in deferred income taxes. The cash decrease resulting from changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an increase of $24.8 million in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $1.9 million in commissions receivable, and a decrease of $3.6 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase of $3.3 million in other liabilities. 

Year Ended June 30, 2022—Cash used in operating activities was $338.3 million, consisting of net loss of $297.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2.2 million, and cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $38.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $92.7 million in deferred income taxes as the Company defers revenue related to certain commissions receivable into following years until it is collected, partially offset by $44.6 million of goodwill impairment charges, $24.7 million of depreciation and amortization related to additional fixed assets purchases to accommodate our growth in headcount and internally developed software in service, $7.1 million of share-based compensation expense, $5.5 million in amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount, and $4.1 million of non-cash lease expense. The cash decrease resulting from changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of increases of $25.7 million in accounts receivable, net related to the increase in approved policies, increases of $10.9 million in other assets primarily related to increases in prepaid balances and SelectRx inventory, and decreases of $5.1 million in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a decrease of $7.3 million in commissions receivable.

Investing Activities

Our investing activities primarily consist of purchases of property, equipment, and software and capitalized salaries related to the development of internal-use software.

Year Ended June 30, 2024—Net cash used in investing activities of $14.8 million was due to $8.3 million in purchases of software and capitalized internal-use software development costs and $3.4 million of purchases of property and equipment, primarily equipment utilized in SelectRx operations to support its expansion, leasehold improvements, and computer equipment. Additionally, we spent $3.4 million to acquire an existing chronic care management platform, which was used to launch SPM.

Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further details concerning material acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Our financing activities primarily consist of proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity and proceeds and payments related to stock-based compensation.

Year Ended June 30, 2024—Net cash used in financing activities of $40.9 million was primarily due $38.9 million of principal payments on the Term Loans.

Year Ended June 30, 2023—Net cash used in financing activities of $29.3 million was primarily due to $10.1 million of debt issuance costs related to the Fourth Amendment, $17.8 million of principal payments on the Term Loans, and $2.4 million of holdback remitted as part of the Express Med acquisition, partially offset by $1.2 million in proceeds from common stock options exercised and the employee stock purchase plan.

Year Ended June 30, 2022—Net cash provided by financing activities of $235.4 million was primarily due to $242.0 million in net proceeds from the DDTL Facility and $3.2 million in proceeds from common stock options exercised and the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by a holdback settlement of $5.5 million for acquisition of a lead distribution company, principal payments of $2.4 million and $1.2 million on the Term Loans and DDTL Facility, respectively, and $0.3 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

Senior Secured Credit Facility

We entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility to provide access to cash, in a variety of methods, when necessary to fund the operations of the business. There were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, there was $688.2 million outstanding under the Term Loans. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Our risk management strategy includes entering into interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. The Company's Amended Interest Rate Swap is designated as a cash flow hedge of the interest payments on $325.0 million in principal of the Term Loans. Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding operating leases for office facilities; our Senior Secured Credit Facility which includes the Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements); and our Amended Interest Rate Swap (as defined in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, we have outstanding service and licensing agreements with various vendors for connectability, maintenance, and other services, including minimum purchase requirements for pharmaceuticals. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements recently adopted and not yet adopted, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We regularly assess these estimates; however, actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The impact of changes in estimates is recorded in the period in which they become known. 

An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance. The accounting estimates we believe to reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions that are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are: revenue recognition for commissions revenue, commissions receivable, accounting for income taxes, share-based compensation, and the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill.

Commission Revenue Recognition and Commissions Receivable 

The estimate of renewal commission revenue is considered variable consideration and requires significant judgment to determine the renewal commission revenue to be recognized at the time the performance obligation is met and in the reassessment of the transaction price each reporting period. This includes determining the number of periods in which a renewal will occur and the value of those renewal commissions to be received if renewed, which includes estimating persistency, the renewal year provision, and an additional product specific constraint applied to account for trends such as industry volatility or uncertainty of consumer behavior patterns. Persistency is the estimate of policies expected to renew each year and renewal year provision is the estimate of policies expected to lapse during each renewal period. The estimated duration of expected renewals used in the calculation of LTV is ten 

years, prior to the application of persistency estimates. Effective for policies sold during the three months ended December 31, 2021, and thereafter, the Company increased the product specific constraint for our largest product, Medicare Advantage, from 6% to 15%. The assumptions used in the Company’s calculation of renewal commission revenue are based on a combination of the Company’s historical experience for renewals, lapses, and payment data; available insurance carrier data; other industry or consumer behavior patterns; and expectations for future retention rates. The estimate of variable consideration is recognized only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with future commissions receivables is subsequently resolved when the policy renews or lapses. The Company is continuously reviewing and monitoring the assumptions and inputs into the Company’s calculation of renewal commission revenue, including reviewing changes in the data used to estimate LTV’s as well as monitoring the cash received for each cohort as compared to the original estimates at the time the policy was sold. The Company assesses the actual renewal data and historical data to identify trends and updates assumptions when a sufficient amount of evidence would suggest that the expectation underlying the assumption has changed and a change in estimate of the transaction price is warranted. The differences in actual cash received for current period renewals may result in an adjustment by cohort (“cohort adjustment”) to revenue and commissions receivable. Cohort adjustments are recognized using actual experience from policy renewals. The Company analyzes cohort adjustments to determine if they are indicative of changes needed in our estimates of future renewal commissions (“tail adjustments”) that remain unresolved as of the reporting period.

Commissions receivable are contract assets that represent estimated variable consideration for performance obligations that have been satisfied but payment is not due as the underlying policy has not renewed yet and are therefore subject to the same assumptions, judgements, and estimates used when recognizing revenue as noted above. The current portion of commissions receivable are future renewal commissions expected to be renewed and collected in cash within one year, while the non-current portion of commissions receivable are expected to be collected beyond one year. Contract assets are reclassified as accounts receivable, net when the rights to the renewal commissions become unconditional, which is primarily upon renewal of the underlying policy, typically on an annual basis. 

Income Taxes 

The Company applies ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires a “more-likely-than-not” (“MLTN”) threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to ASC 740 and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the Company’s tax return. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The Company recognizes a significant deferred tax liability due to the timing of recognizing revenue when a policy is sold, while revenue for tax purposes is not recognized until future renewal commission payments are received. This deferred tax liability is an objective source of future income that can be used to support the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets. The Company has established a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets associated with federal and state specific net operating losses (“NOL”) and credits that are not more likely than not to be realized. The Company believes all other deferred tax assets outside of the certain deferred tax asset related to federal and state credits where a valuation allowance has been established are more likely than not to be recognized. 

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize share-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss based on the fair value of our stock-based awards over their respective vesting periods, depending on the plan. The estimated grant date fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The expected term for stock options granted is determined using the simplified method, which deems the expected 

term to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual life of the stock-based awards. The dividend yield is determined by dividing the expected per share dividend during the coming year by the grant date stock price, however, we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We base the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of our stock options. Expected volatility is determined using historical stock prices for a combination of publicly traded peer group companies and our stock price. The estimated grant date fair value of our PVU’s are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model that uses assumptions determined as of the date of the grant. These assumptions include estimating the volatility of the Company's common stock price over the expected term, the risk-free interest rate that reflects the interest rate at grant date on zero-coupon United States governmental bonds that have a remaining life similar to the expected term risk-free interest rate, the cost of equity, and the dividend yield assumption which is based on the Company's dividend payment history and management's expectations of future dividend payments. The estimated attainment of performance-based awards and related expense is based on the expectations of target achievement. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards and expected attainment of performance or market based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term and volatility related to our own stock-based awards on a prospective basis, and incorporating these factors into the model. Changes in key assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of such instruments.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. This assessment considers various financial, macroeconomic, industry and segment specific qualitative factors. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value, goodwill is written down by the excess amount, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units under ASC 350 by using an income approach, a market approach, or a combination thereof, which involves the use of significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), and require us to make various judgmental assumptions around future revenues and operating costs, growth rates, and discount rates which consider our budgets, business plans, and economic projections. As such, these estimates are uncertain and may vary from actual results. Under the income approach, we utilize the discounted cash flow method while under the market approach, we utilize a peer-based guideline public company method based on published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.

There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded for the years end June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, as the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value. As a result of our annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2022, the Company recorded $44.6 million in goodwill impairment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended June 30, 2022. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
