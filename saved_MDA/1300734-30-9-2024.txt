Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements.” All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, assumptions or future events. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “could,” and similar expressions denoting uncertainty or an action that may, will or is expected to occur in the future. These statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

Examples of forward-looking statements include:

| ● | the timing of the development of future products; 
---|---|--- 
| | 
| ● | projections of revenue, earnings, capital structure, and other financial items; 
| | 
| ● | local, regional, national, and global price fluctuations of raw materials; 
| | 
| ● | statements of our plans and objectives, including those that relate to our proposed expansions and the effect such expansions may have on our revenue; 
| | 
| ● | statements regarding the capabilities of our business operations; 
| | 
| ● | statements of expected future economic performance; 
| | 
| ● | the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
| | 
| ● | statements regarding competition in our market; and 
| | 
| ● | assumptions underlying statements regarding us or our business. 

The ultimate correctness of these forward-looking statements depends upon a number of known and unknown risks and events. Many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Consequently, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Nonetheless, we reserve the right to make such updates from time to time by press release, periodic report, or other method of public disclosure without the need for specific reference to this Annual Report. No such update shall be deemed to indicate that other statements not addressed by such update is incorrect or create an obligation to provide any other updates.

The information included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes included in this Annual Report. All monetary figures are presented in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

General Overview

Shineco, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Prior to the following acquisition and the termination of the VIE structure, as a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conducted a substantial majority of our operations through the operating entities established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily the variable interest entities (the “VIEs”). We did not have any equity ownership of the VIEs, instead we received the economic benefits of the VIEs’ business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock that currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets are shares of our Delaware holding company. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities could decline or become worthless.

On December 30, 2022, Shineco Life Science Group Hong Kong Co., Limited (“Shineco Life”), a company established under the laws of Hong Kong and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the acquisition of 51% of the issued equity interests of Changzhou Biowin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Biowin”), a company established under the laws of China, pursuant to the previously announced stock purchase agreement, dated as of October 21, 2022, among Beijing Kanghuayuan Medicine Information Consulting Co., Ltd., a company established under the laws of China (“Seller”), Biowin, the Company and Shineco Life. As the consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to Seller US$9,000,000 in cash and the Company issued 326,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value US$0.001 per share, to the equity holders of Biowin or any persons designated by Biowin. According to a supplementary agreement, dated as of December 30, 2022, by and among Shineco Life, the Seller and Biowin, the Seller owned 51% of the issued equity interests of Biowin before January 1, 2023, and transferred the 51% of the issued equity interests of Biowin together with its controlling rights of production and operation of Biowin to Shineco Life on January 1, 2023.

On May 29, 2023, Shineco Life entered into a stock purchase agreement with Dream Partner Limited, a BVI corporation (“Dream Partner”), Chongqing Wintus Group, a corporation incorporated under the laws of mainland China (“Wintus”), and certain shareholders of Dream Partner (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which Shineco Life shall acquire 71.42% equity interest in Wintus (the “Acquisition”). On September 19, 2023, the Company closed the Acquisition. As the consideration for the Acquisition, the Company (a) paid the Sellers an aggregate cash consideration of US$2,000,000; (b) issued certain shareholders, as listed in the agreement, an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted Common Stock; and (c) transferred and sold to the Sellers 100% of the Company’s equity interest in Beijing Tenet-Jove Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet-Jove Shares”). Following the closing of the Acquisition and the sale of the Tenet-Jove Shares, the Company divested its equity interest in its operating subsidiary Tenet-Jove (“Tenet-Jove Disposal Group”) and thereby terminated its VIE Structure.

We used our subsidiaries’ vertically and horizontally integrated production, distribution, and sales channels to provide health and well-being focused plant-based products. Through our newly acquired subsidiary, Biowin, which specializes in the development, production and distribution of innovative rapid diagnostic products and related medical devices for the most common diseases, we also stepped into the Point-of-Care Testing industry. Also, following the acquisition of Wintus, we entered into a new business segment of producing, processing and distributing agricultural products, such as silk, silk fabrics and fresh fruit. Meanwhile, our newly established subsidiary, Fuzhou Meida, opened its restaurant, which is a health-oriented chain restaurant that focuses on the concept of “improving metabolism through diet.” As of June 30, 2024, the Company, through its subsidiaries, operates the following main business segments:

Developing, producing and distributing innovative rapid diagnostic products and related medical devices for the most common diseases (“Rapid Diagnostic and Other Products”) \- This segment is conducted through Biowin, which specializes in the development, production and distribution of innovative rapid diagnostic products and related medical devices for the most common diseases. The operations of this segment are located in Jiangsu Province. Its products are sold not only in China, but also overseas countries such as Germany, Spain, Italy, Thailand, Japan and other countries.

Producing, processing and distribution of agricultural products, such as silk and silk fabrics as well as fresh fruits (“Other agricultural products”): – This segment is conducted through Wintus, which specializes in producing, processing and distribution of agricultural products, such as silk and silk fabrics as well as trading of fresh fruit. The operations of this segment are located in Chongqing, China. Its products are sold not only in China, but also overseas countries such as United States, Europe (Germany, France, Italy, Poland), Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia (India, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Cambodia), among other countries and regions. In addition to silk products, Wintus also engages in fruit trading business. It imports fruits from Southeast Asia and other regions, distributing them through dealers to supermarkets and stores nationwide in China.

Developing and selling healthy meals for people with slow metabolic health and those in recovery from metabolic disorders. (“Healthy meals products”): – This segment is conducted through Fuzhou Meida, which specializes in developing healthy meals for people with slow metabolic health and those in recovery from metabolic disorders. Fuzhou Meida recently opened its restaurant in Fuzhou city, Fujian Province. The restaurant features an open kitchen and adopts a modern Chinese style, offering a variety of modern Chinese healthy light meals and metabolism-boosting meal sets. The Company plans to gradually establish additional branches in key cities across China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other southeastern coastal regions.

Tenet-Jove Disposal Group conducts three other business segments. First, developing, manufacturing, and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles, and other by-products derived from an indigenous Chinese plant Apocynum Venetum, known in Chinese as “Luobuma” or “Bluish Dogbane,” as well as Luoboma raw materials processing; this segment is conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary, Tenet-Jove. Second, planting, processing and distributing green and organic agricultural produce, growing and cultivation of yew trees, as well as planting fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic greening trees; this segment is conducted through Qingdao Zhihesheng and Guangyuan. Third, providing domestic air and overland freight forwarding services by outsourcing these services to a third party; this segment is conducted through Zhisheng Freight. These three business segments were reclassified as discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities of the Tenet-Jove Disposal Group have been reclassified as “assets of discontinued operations” and “liabilities of discontinued operations” within current and non-current assets and liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations of Tenet-Jove Disposal Group have been reclassified to “net income (loss) from discontinued operations” in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Factors Affecting Financial Performance

We believe that the following factors will affect our financial performance:

Increasing demand for our products – We believe that the increasing demand for our products will have a positive impact on our financial position. We plan to develop new products and expand our distribution network as well as to grow our business through possible mergers and acquisitions of similar or synergetic businesses, all aimed at increasing awareness of our brand, developing customer loyalty, meeting customer demands in various markets and providing solid foundations for our growth. As of the date of this Annual Report, however, we do not have any agreements, undertakings or understandings to acquire any such entities and there can be no guarantee that we ever will.

Maintaining effective control of our costs and expenses \- Successful cost control depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain adequate material supplies as required by our operations at competitive prices. We will focus on improving our long-term cost control strategies including establishing long-term alliances with certain suppliers to ensure adequate supply is maintained. We will carry forward the economies of scale and advantages from our nationwide distribution network and diversified offerings.

Economic and Political Risks

Our operations are conducted primarily in the PRC and subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies operating in North America and/or Western Europe. These include risks with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversions, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.

COVID-19 Impact

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines, and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus. In accordance with the epidemic control measures imposed by the local governments related to COVID-19, our offices and retail stores were closed or had limited business operations occasionally. In addition, COVID-19 had caused severe disruptions in transportation, limited access to our facilities and limited support from workforce employed in our operations, and as a result, we experienced delays or the inability to delivery our products to customers on a timely basis. Further, some of our customers or suppliers experienced financial distress, delayed or defaults on payment, sharp diminishing of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak. Any decreased collectability of accounts receivable, delayed raw materials supply, bankruptcy of small and medium businesses, or early termination of agreements due to deterioration in economic conditions could negatively impact our results of operations. Wider-spread COVID-19 in China and globally could prolong the deterioration in economic conditions and could cause decreases in or delays in spending and reduce and/or negatively impact our short-term ability to grow our revenue. In early December 2022, China announced a nationwide loosening of its zero-COVID policy, and the country faced a wave in infections after the lifting of these restrictions. Although the spread of the COVID-19 was slowed down and appears to be successfully under control currently, the extent of the future impact of COVID-19 is still highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date our consolidated financial statements are released.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require significant judgments and estimates. For additional information relating to these and other accounting policies, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision-making ability. All VIEs and their subsidiaries with which the Company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes.

There are no consolidated assets of the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries that are collateral for the obligations of the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries and can only be used to settle the obligations of the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries.

As the VIEs are incorporated as limited liability companies under the PRC Company Law, creditors or beneficial interest holders of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company for any of the liabilities of the VIEs in normal course of business.

There are no terms in any arrangements, considering both explicit arrangements and implicit variable interests that require the Company or its subsidiaries to provide financial support to the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries. However, if the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries ever need financial support, the Company or its subsidiaries may, at their option and subject to statutory limits and restrictions, provide financial support to the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries through loans to the shareholder of the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries or entrustment loans to the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries.

Use of Estimates

Significant estimates required to be made by management include, but are not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, and intangible assets, the recoverability of long-lived assets, assessment of expected credit losses for accounts receivable and other current asset, the valuation allowance of deferred taxes and inventory reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Credit Losses

On July 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. The adoption of the credit loss accounting standard has no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of July 1, 2023.

The Company’s account receivables and other receivables included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets are within the scope of ASC Topic 326. The Company makes estimates of expected credit and collectability trends for the allowance for credit losses based upon assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable and other receivables balances, credit-worthiness of the customers and other debtors, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect its ability to collect from the customers and other debtors. The Company also provides specific provisions for allowance when facts and circumstances indicate that the receivable is unlikely to be collected.

ASC Topic 326 is also applicable to loans to third parties that are included in the other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Management estimates the allowance for credit losses on loans does not share similar risk characteristics on an individual basis. The key factors considered when determining the above allowances for credit losses include estimated loan collection schedule, discount rate, and assets and financial performance of the borrowers.

Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. In the event the Company recovers amounts previously reserved, the Company will reduce the specific allowance for credit losses.

Inventories, Net

Inventories, which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, consist of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods related to the Company’s products. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business less any costs to complete and sell products. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. The Company periodically evaluates its inventory and records an inventory reserve for certain inventories that may not be saleable or whose cost exceeds net realizable value. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the inventory reserve from the continuing operations was US$30,443 and US$56,655, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the inventory reserve from the discontinued operations was nil and US$1,106,649, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

We generate our revenue primarily through sales of Luobuma products, other agricultural products, healthy meals and rapid diagnostic and other products, as well as providing logistic services and other processing services to external customers in accordance with ASC 606. ASC 606 establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.

With the adoption of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” revenue is recognized when all of the following five steps are met: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by reviewing its existing customer contracts to identify differences that will result from applying the new requirements, including the evaluation of its performance obligations, transaction price, customer payments, transfer of control, and principal versus agent considerations. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When the Company is a principal, that the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customers, the revenue should be recognized in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified goods or services transferred. When the Company is an agent and its obligation is to facilitate third parties in fulfilling their performance obligation for specified goods or services, the revenue should be recognized in the net amount for the amount of commission which the Company earns in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by other parties. Based on the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no change to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope of Topic 606 and therefore there was no material changes to the Company’s financial statements upon adoption of ASC 606.

More specifically, revenue related to our products and services is generally recognized as follows:

Sales of products: We recognized revenue from the sale of products at the point in time when the goods were delivered and title to the goods passed to the customer, provided that there were no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed; the sales price was fixed or determinable; and collectability was deemed probable.

Revenue from provision of services: The Company merely acts as an agent in these types of services transactions. Revenue from domestic air and overland freight forwarding services was recognized at the point in time upon the performance of services as stipulated in the underlying contract or when commodities were being released from the customer’s warehouse; the service price was fixed or determinable; and collectability was deemed probable.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We follow the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs, other than quoted prices in level, that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.

The carrying value of financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023

Overview

The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:

Revenue

Currently, we, through our PRC subsidiaries, have three major business segments from continuing operations. First, developing, producing and distributing innovative rapid diagnostic and other products and related medical devices for the most common diseases; this segment is conducted through Biowin. Second, producing, processing and distributing silk products, and providing fruit trading business; this segment is conducted through Wintus. Third, developing and selling healthy meals for people with slow metabolic health and those in recovery from metabolic disorders; this segment is conducted through Fuzhou Meida.

The following table sets forth the breakdown of our revenue for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of rapid diagnostic and other products was US$543,791 and US$550,476, respectively, representing a slight decrease of US$6,685, or 1.21%.

For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of other agricultural products was US$9,235,692 and nil, respectively, representing an increase of US$9,235,692, or 100.00%. The increase was mainly due to revenue generated by our newly acquired subsidiary Wintus during the year ended June 30, 2024.

For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of healthy meal products was US$22,373 and nil, respectively, representing an increase of US$22,373, or 100.00%. The increase was mainly due to revenue generated by our subsidiary Fuzhou Meida, which only started its operation during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Cost of Revenue and Related Tax

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the cost of revenue for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue from sales of rapid diagnostic and other products was US$221,975 and US$421,273, respectively, representing a decrease of US$199,298, or 47.31%. The decrease in sales of rapid diagnostic and other products was less than the decrease in cost of revenue from sales of rapid diagnostic and other products during the year ended June 30, 2024, which was mainly due to fewer sales of Covid-19 test reagents, as discussed in “—Gross Profit (Loss)” below.

For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue from sales of other agricultural products was US$8,636,258 and nil, respectively, representing an increase of US$8,636,258, or 100.00%. The increase was mainly due to cost of revenue generated by our newly acquired subsidiary Wintus during the year ended June 30, 2024.

For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue from sales of healthy meal products was US$47,401 and nil, respectively, representing an increase of US$47,401, or 100.00%. The increase was mainly due to cost of revenue generated by our subsidiary Fuzhou Meida, which only started its operation during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Gross Income (Loss)

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the gross income (loss) for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

Gross income from sales of rapid diagnostic and other products increased by US$193,188, or 153.1%, for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. After China announced a nationwide loosening of its zero-COVID policy in December 2022, there were significant surges of COVID-19 cases in China during that time, which resulted in higher demand for Covid-19 test reagents. However, we sold our COVID-19 test reagents at a very low profit margin due to the intense competition from our rivals, and we also tried to clear our remaining stock after the demand for COVID-19 test reagents dropped as the spread of the COVID-19 slowed down and appeared to be under control. During the year ended June 30, 2024, no revenue was generated from COVID-19 test reagents, and our gross margin increased significantly as we sold other products with higher margins.

Gross income from sales of other agricultural products increased by US$587,833, or 100.00%, for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to gross income contributed by our newly acquired subsidiary Wintus during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Gross loss from sales of healthy meal products increased by US$25,038, or 100.00%, for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to gross loss contributed by our subsidiary Fuzhou Meida, which only started its operation during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Expenses

The following table sets forth the breakdown of our operating expenses for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

General and Administrative Expenses

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our general and administrative expenses were US$17,522,624, representing an increase of US$8,912,032, or 103.50%, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to the increased expenses of approximately US$3,000,000 as a result of the forgiveness of the subscription receivable upon settlement of the Company’s legal case; see more details in “Capital Commitments and Contingencies.” The increase was also due to the increased professional service fee in relation to the acquisition of Wintus of approximately US$800,000, as well as increased general and administrative expenses of approximately US$4,800,000 incurred by our subsidiary Biowin with full-year operation as compared to six-month operation last year, and by our newly acquired subsidiary Wintus and other subsidiaries that fully started their operation during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Selling Expenses

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our selling expenses were US$311,989, representing an increase of US$174,602, or 127.09%, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to selling expenses incurred by our subsidiary Biowin with full-year operation as compared to six-month operation last year, and by our newly acquired subsidiary Wintus and other subsidiaries that fully started their operation during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Research and Development Expenses

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our research and development expenses were US$113,426, representing a decrease of US$22,423, or 16.51%, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to less research and development activities towards products development during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Impairment Loss on an Unconsolidated Entity

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our impairment loss on an unconsolidated entity was US$26,003, representing a decrease of US$570,567, or 95.64%, as compared to impairment loss on an unconsolidated entity of US$596,570 for the same period in 2023.

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with the shareholders of Fujian Xiao Xinglin Medical Technology Co., Ltd (“Fujian Xiao Xinglin”) to complete the injection of a total of RMB 187,500 (approximately US$26,000) for its 15% equity interest in Fujian Xiao Xinglin. However, as Fujian Xiao Xinglin did not start its business operation according to the business plan due to geographic restrictions, the Company and other shareholders of Fujian Xiao Xinglin decided to transfer their shares to a new investee, and at the same time, the Company reduced its capital injection to RMB 100,000 (approximately US$14,000). However, Fujian Xiao Xinglin failed to transfer the capital injected by the Company to the new investee and refused to return the excess amount back to the Company.

On August 31, 2021, we entered into a capital injection agreement with the other shareholders of Shanghai Gaojing Private Fund Management (“Gaojing Private Fund”), a Chinese private fund management company, to complete the injection of a total RMB 4.8 million (approximately US$0.70 million) for its 32% equity interest in Gaojing Private Fund. On June 28,2024, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement to transfer its 32% equity interest in Shanghai Gaojing to a third party, and the transaction is expected to be completed by March 31, 2025.

The management performed an evaluation of the impairment of this investment and considered it unlikely to obtain any investment income in the future. Hence, the management fully recorded impairment loss on these investments, and an impairment loss on an unconsolidated entity of US$26,003 and US$596,570 was recorded for the year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Impairment Loss on Goodwill

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our impairment loss on goodwill was US$14,824,819. In conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated financial statement for the year ended June 30, 2024, our management performed an evaluation of the impairment of goodwill. Due to the lower-than-expected revenue and profit, and unfavorable business environment, the management recorded impairment loss on goodwill of Biowin and Wintus amounted to US$14,824,819 for the year ended June 30, 2024.

Other Income, Net

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our net other income was US$222,910, representing an increase of US$41,439, or 22.84%, as compared to net other income of US$181,471 in the same period in 2023. The increase in net other income was mainly attributable to the increased government subsidies received during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Amortization of Debt Issuance and Other Costs

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our amortization of debt issuance and other costs expenses was US$655,751, representing a decrease of US$147,604, or 18.37%, as compared to amortization of debt issuance and other costs expenses of US$803,355 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was in line with the decreased balance of convertible notes as of June 30, 2024, as the Company continued issuing shares and made cash repayment during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Interest Expenses, Net

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our net interest expenses were US$1,622,346, representing an increase of US$713,587, or 78.52%, as compared to net interest expenses of US$908,759 in the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest expenses was mainly attributable to the increased interest expenses on short-term and long-term loans borrowed by our newly acquired subsidiaries, Biowin and Wintus.

Benefit for Income Taxes

For the year ended June 30, 2024, our benefit for income taxes was US$758,902, representing an increase of US$564,338, or 290.05%, as compared to benefit for income taxes of US$194,564 in the same period in 2023. The increase in benefit for income taxes was mainly due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the amortization of intangible assets, which are trademarks, patents and land use rights that were revalued upon the acquisition of Biowin and Wintus. The increase was partially offset by the increased provision for income taxes as a result of increased valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded by our newly acquired subsidiary, Wintus.

Net Loss from Continuing Operations

Our net loss from continuing operations was US$33,207,982 for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of US$22,496,814, or 210.03%, from net loss from continuing operations of US$10,711,168 for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net loss from continuing operations was primarily a result of the increase in general and administrative expenses and impairment loss on goodwill.

Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

As mentioned above, due to the acquisition of Wintus mentioned above, the Company’s Luobuma, Agricultural Products and Freight Services business segments, that are operated by the Tenet-Jove Disposal Group, are reclassified as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We had a total net income from discontinued operations of US$8,855,247 and a net loss from discontinued operations of US$3,244,863 for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The summarized operating results of our discontinued operations included in our consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss is as follows:

Net Loss

Our net loss was US$24,352,735 for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of US$10,396,704, or 74.50%, from a net loss of US$13,956,031 for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily a result of the increased net loss from continuing operations, partially offset by the increased net income from discontinued operations, as discussed above.

Comprehensive Loss

The comprehensive loss was US$24,356,034 for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of US$7,488,720 from a comprehensive loss of US$16,867,314 for the year ended June 30, 2023. After deduction of non-controlling interest, the comprehensive loss attributable to us was US$22,444,175 for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to a comprehensive loss attributable to us in the amount of US$16,255,024 for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase in comprehensive loss was due to the increased net loss as discussed above and the decrease in the recorded loss of foreign currency translation where the financial statements denominated in RMB were translated to the USD denomination.

Treasury Policies

We have established treasury policies with the objectives of achieving effective control of treasury operations and of lowering cost of funds. Therefore, funding for all operations and foreign exchange exposure have been centrally reviewed and monitored from the top level. To manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates on specific transactions and foreign currency borrowings, currency structured instruments and other appropriate financial instruments will be used to hedge material exposure, if any.

Our policy precludes us from entering into any derivative contracts purely for speculative activities. Through our treasury policies, we aim to:

(a) Minimize interest risk

This is accomplished by loan re-financing and negotiation. We will continue to closely monitor the total loan portfolio and compare the loan margin spread under our existing agreements against the current borrowing interest rates under different currencies and new offers from banks.

(b) Minimize currency risk

In view of the current volatile currency market, we will closely monitor the foreign currency borrowings at the company level. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, except the above-mentioned convertible note, we did not engage in any foreign currency borrowings or loan contracts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We currently finance our business operations primarily through advances from our related parties, short-term and long-term loans, convertible notes and the sale of our common stock. Our current cash primarily consists of cash on hand and cash in bank, which is unrestricted as to withdrawal and use and is deposited with banks in China.

As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately US$13.5 million in short-term bank loans and US$1.7 million in long-term bank loans outstanding. We expect that we will be able to renew all of the existing bank loans upon their maturity based on our past experience and outstanding credit history.

On July 11, 2024, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with EF Hutton LLC, as the representative for several underwriters, relating to the underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 1,869,160 shares of common stock, par value US$0.001 per share of the Company, at a public offering price of US$1.07 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately US$2.0 million, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 280,374 shares of its common stock at the public offering price per share, less the underwriting discounts to cover over-allotments, if any. The Offering closed on July 15, 2024, and the 45-day option expired on August 30, 2024.

As disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company had recurring net losses from continuing operations of US$33.2 million and US$10.7 million, and continuing cash outflow of US$3.9 million and US$5.4 million from operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had accumulated a deficit of US$54.3 million and US$31.7 million, and as of June 30, 2024, the Company had negative working capital of US$6.7 million. The Company’s management believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. In assessing the Company’s going concern, the Company’s management monitors and analyzes the Company’s cash on-hand and its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future to support its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. Direct offering and debt financing have been utilized to finance the working capital requirements of the Company. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through the next twelve months is dependent on the continued financial support from its stockholders. The Company’s management believes that the Company’s current access to loans, equity financing as well as financial support from its shareholders will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. The Company intends to continue to carefully execute its growth plans and manage market risk. If the Company fails to satisfy the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC’s (“Nasdaq”) continued listing requirements, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist its common stock. Any continuing failure to remain in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards and any subsequent failure to timely resume compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards within the applicable cure period could have adverse consequences and, among other things, substantially impair the Company’s ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for the Company.

Working Capital

The following table provides the information about our working capital at June 30, 2024 and 2023:

The working capital decreased by US$35,574,935, or 123.0%, as of June 30, 2024 from June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in current assets held for discontinued operations, an increase in short-term loans, an increase in other payables and accrued expenses, and an increase in due to related parties, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and advances to supplies and a decrease in current liabilities held for discontinued operations.

Capital Commitments and Contingencies

Capital commitments refer to the allocation of funds for the possible purchase in the near future for fixed assets or investment. Contingency refers to a condition that arises from past transactions or events, the outcome of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain futures events.

On November 26, 2021, the Company filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County against Lei Zhang and Yan Li, as defendants, and Transhare Corporation, as a nominal defendant, asserting that defendants had not paid for certain restricted shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to stock purchase agreements they executed with the Company. In December, defendants filed an answer and counterclaim against the Company, which they amended on January 27, 2022 after the Company moved to dismiss their counterclaims. They brought claims for, among others, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud, asserting that the Company made false and materially misleading statements, specifically regarding the sale of such shares to Lei Zhang and Yan Li and the removal of their restrictive legends. Defendants are seeking money damages of at least US$9 million, punitive damages of US$10 million, plus interest, costs, and fees. In April 2022, the Court granted the Company’s motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the Company’s transfer agent from removing the restrictive legends on the shares, provided that the Company posts a bond, which the Company declined to do. On June 13, 2022, the restriction imposed on the shares were lifted.

Nominal defendant Transhare Corporation moved to dismiss the defendants’ counterclaim against it for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions pursuant to 6 Del. C. § 8-401, and its motion was fully submitted in April 2022. On September 9, 2022, the Court granted Transhare Corporation’s motion to dismiss defendants’ counterclaim for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions. Defendants have appealed the Court’s September 9, 2022 order dismissing defendants’ counterclaim for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions. On October 3, 2022, the parties submitted a stipulation dismissing defendants’ outstanding counterclaim against Transhare Corporation seeking declaratory judgment.

The Company participated in a formal mediation with the defendants Lei Zhang and Yan Li on September 18, 2023. As a result of the mediation, the parties were able to reach a settlement agreement in December 2023. The parties executed a Settlement Agreement on December 21, 2023, and the claims by each side were formally dismissed by the court on December 22, 2023. The subscription receivable amounted to US$3,024,000 was waived by the Company during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and the Company will not retrieve the shares that were issued to the defendants.

As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no other material capital commitments or contingent liabilities.

Contractual Obligations

The Company has no long-term fixed contractual obligations or commitments other than leases that are disclosed in Note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements

On May 29, 2023, the Board of the Company approved that we pledged our property as collateral to guarantee a personal loan of a related party, Mr. Yuying Zhang, the legal representative of Tenet-Jove. Based on the memorandum entered between us and Mr. Yuying Zhang, Mr. Yuying Zhang was expected to repay his loan and release the pledge before May 31, 2024, and we have the right to claim full compensation if the property fails to be released by the due date. On May 23, 2024, Mr. Yuying Zhang entered into another supplementary agreement with Weiqing Guo, wherein the parties agreed to extend the due date of the principal amount from May 23, 2024 to May 23, 2025, and the real estate property continued to be pledged till May 23, 2025. If Yuying Zhang fails to repay the loan and the property is executed by the Court, the Company has the right to pursue compensation from Zhang Yuying based on the market value of the property. As of June 30, 2024, the net book value of the property was US$1,012,381.

The Company’s subsidiary, Chongqing Wintus (New Star) Enterprises Group (“Chongqing Wintus”), provided a guarantee amounted to US$687,999 for a bank loan borrowed by Chongqing Yufan, a related party of the Company till December 28, 2025.

Except for the above-mentioned guarantee, we have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own common stock and classified as stockholders’ equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
