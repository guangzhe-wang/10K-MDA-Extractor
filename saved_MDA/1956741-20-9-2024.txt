ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

All periods presented on or prior to October 16, 2022 represent the operations of CleanCore, TetraClean and Food Safety, our predecessors companies, and all references to “predecessor” refer to the combined financial position and results of operations of CleanCore, TetraClean and Food Safety on and before such date. References to “successor” refer to the financial position and results of operations of our company subsequent to October 16, 2022. 

Overview

We specialize in the development and production of cleaning products that produce pure aqueous ozone for professional, industrial, or home use. We have a patented nanobubble technology using aqueous ozone that we believe is highly effective in cleaning, sanitizing, and deodorizing surfaces and high-touch areas.

We offer products and solutions that are marketed for janitorial and sanitation, ice machine cleaning, laundry, and industrial industries. Our products are used in many types of environments including retail establishments, distribution centers, factories, warehouses, restaurants, schools and universities, airports, healthcare, food service, and commercial buildings such as offices, malls, and stores.

Our mission is to become a leader in creating safe, clean spaces that are free from any chemical residue or skin irritants. We are currently expanding our distributor network, improving our production processes, and proving the effectiveness of our products in restaurants, airports, and hotels.


Recent Developments

Product Development Proposal

On August 20, 2024, we entered into a product development proposal with E-Business International Incorporation, pursuant to which Business International Incorporation, an engineering company, will look for more efficient ways to assemble some of our units, and will then take over assembly of certain products using overseas facilities.

Distributor Agreement

On September 10, 2024, we entered into a sole distributorship agreement with Consensus B.V., pursuant to which Consensus B.V. will act as sole distributor of our products in the European Union, United Kingdom, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. The agreement is for a term of five years and may be terminated by either party upon not less than four months’ notice; provided that either party may terminate the agreement immediately upon a substantial breach of the agreement, as more particularly described in the agreement.

Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance

Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:

| ●| our ability to acquire new customers or retain existing customers; 
---|---|--- 

| ●| our ability to stay ahead of our value-proposition to end consumers; 
---|---|--- 

| ●| our ability to continue innovating our technology to meet consumer demand; 
---|---|--- 

| ●| industry demand and competition; and 
---|---|--- 

| ●| market conditions and our market position. 
---|---|--- 

Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

| ●| have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
---|---|--- 

| ●| comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
---|---|--- 

| ●| submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and 
---|---|--- 

| ●| disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. 
---|---|--- 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.235 billion or more, (iii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our class B common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


Results of Operations

The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the period from July 1, 2022 to October 16, 2022 (Predecessor), from October 17, 2022 to June 30, 2023 (Successor), and for the year ended June 30, 2024 (Successor).

We believe that reviewing our operating results for the year ended June 30, 2023, by combining the results of the successor period (October 17, 2022 to June 30, 2023) and the predecessor period (July 1, 2022 to October 16, 2022) is more useful in discussing our overall operating performance compared to the results of the year ended June 30, 2024 (successor). We do not see any potential risks associated with utilizing this combined presentation.

Following are the combined results for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, both in dollars and as a percentage of our revenues.

Revenue. We generate revenue from sales of our cleaning products. Our revenue decreased by $836,383, or 34.26%, to $1,604,973 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $2,441,356 for the year ended June 30, 2023. This reduction in revenue was primarily due to the fact that our previous largest customer decided to make its own units instead of ordering from us commencing at the start of calendar year 2023. Revenue to this customer declined by 96% during the fiscal year, which represented over 80% of total revenue decline. The remaining decline is the result of management’s strategy of shifting focus to selling at higher margins direct to end users instead of selling through regional distribution groups at lower margins.


Cost of sales. Our cost of sales consists of raw materials, components and labor. Our cost of sales decreased by $901,980, or 52.71%, to $809,161 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $1,711,141 for the year ended June 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales decreased from 70.09% for the year ended June 30, 2023 to 50.42% for the year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to our strategy of selling direct to end users instead of selling via regional distribution groups.

Gross profit. As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased by $65,597, or 8.98%, to $795,812 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $730,215 for the year ended June 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased from 29.91% for the year ended June 30, 2023 to 49.58% for the year ended June 30, 2024.

General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including employee salaries and bonuses plus related payroll taxes, professional advisor fees, bad debts, rent expense, insurance and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by $3,174,016, or 56.22%, to $2,471,480 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $5,645,496 for the year ended June 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our general and administrative expenses decreased from 231.24% for the year ended June 30, 2023 to 153.99% for the year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in stock option expense.

Advertising expenses. Our advertising expenses consist of vendor trade shows and various trade publications. Our advertising expenses increased by $96,442, or 492.93%, to $116,007 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $19,565 for the year ended June 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our advertising expenses increased from 0.80% for the year ended June 30, 2023 to 7.23% for the year ended June 30, 2024. Such an increase was primarily due to an increase in trade show sponsorship expenses.

Depreciation and amortization expense. We incurred depreciation and amortization expense of $155,059, or 9.66% of revenue, for the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $115,564, or 4.73% of revenue, for the year ended June 30, 2023.

Interest expense. We incurred interest expense of $335,008, or 20.87% of revenue, for the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $292,861, or 12.00% of revenue, for the year ended June 30, 2023.

Net loss. As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had a net loss of $2,281,742 for the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $5,343,271 for the year ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of $3,061,529, or 57.30%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. From acquisition through June 30, 2024, we have financed our operations primarily through private investor funding and an initial public offering. As of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,016,611, a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2024 of $2,281,742 and cash used in operating activities of $1,547,880.

Despite the initial public offering described below, management believes that currently available resources will not be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures over the next 12 months. These factors, individually and collectively indicate that a material uncertainty exists that raises substantial doubt about our company’s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date of issuance of the accompanying financial statements.

We will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through equity and/or debt financing in order to implement our business plan and generate sufficient revenue in excess of costs. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. There is no assurance that we will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Thes accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which our company is expected to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business.

On April 25, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Boustead Securities, LLC, as the representative of the several underwriters named on Schedule 1 thereto, relating to our initial public offering of class B common stock. Under the underwriting agreement, we agreed to sell 1,250,000 shares of class B common stock to the underwriters, at a purchase price per share of $3.72 (the offering price to the public of $4.00 per share of class B common stock minus the underwriters’ discount), and also agreed to grant to the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 187,500 additional shares of class B common stock, at a purchase price of $3.72, pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-274928) under the Securities Act.

Promissory Notes

On October 17, 2022, we issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $3,000,000 to Burlington, which amended by an extension agreement dated September 13, 2023, a second extension agreement dated December 17, 2023, a third extension agreement dated April 30, 2024, and a fourth extension agreement dated May 20, 2024. The note bore interest at a rate of 7% per annum; provided that such interest rate increased to 10% per annum on September 13, 2023. The note was due on the earlier of (a) the closing of a firm commitment initial public offering and concurrent listing on a national securities exchange or (b) April 4, 2024.

On May 31, 2024, Burlington and Walker Water LLC, or WW, entered into an allonge, assignment and agreement, or the Assignment Agreement, pursuant to which Burlington agreed to transfer $633,840 of the note to WW. The Assignment Agreement also provided that we would make a payment of $900,000 to Burlington on May 31, 2024, of which $480,667 will reduce the principal amount of the note, and $419,333 will pay outstanding interest. On May 31, 2024, we issued an amended and restated promissory note to Burlington to reduce the outstanding principal of the note due to Burlington’s assignment of a portion of the note to WW and due to the foregoing payment. The note has a new principal amount of $2,366,160, accrues interest at 8.5% per annum from October 17, 2022 (the date of the original note), which shall increase to 10% upon an event of default, and requires quarterly payments in the amount of $100,000 over the course of the next two and a half years, with a final payment of $1,396,881 due on April 1, 2027. The note may be prepaid at any time with no pre-payment penalty and contains customary events of default for a note of this type. As of June 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of this note is $1,885,493 and it has accrued interest of $13,673.

Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, we also issued a new promissory note to WW in the principal amount of $633,840. The note accrues interest at 8.5% per annum from October 17, 2022 (the date of the original note), which shall increase to 10% upon an event of default and is due on December 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid at any time with no pre-payment penalty and contains customary events of default for a note of this type. As of June 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of this note is $633,840 and it has accrued interest of $4,490.

Both notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment to any other unsecured indebtedness incurred in favor of any third party.

Related Party Revolving Loan

On March 26, 2024, we entered into a loan agreement with Clayton Adams, a significant stockholder at such time and our current Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which we issued a revolving credit note to Mr. Adams in the principal amount of up to $500,000. Pursuant to the loan agreement and note, Mr. Adams agreed to provide advances to us upon request during the period commencing on the effective date of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering (April 25, 2024) and continuing until the second anniversary of such date, which is referred to as the maturity date. This note accrues simple interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of 8% per annum, with all principal and interest due on the maturity date; provided that upon an event of default (as defined in the note), such rate shall increase to 13%. We may prepay the note at any time without penalty or premium. The note is unsecured and contains customary events of default for a loan of this type. As of June 30, 2024, no advances have been made and the principal amount of this note is $0.

Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under the loans described above. Other than indicated above, at June 30, 2024, we did not have other long-term debt obligations, capital (finance) lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities reflected on our statements of financial position.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.


Critical Accounting Policies

The following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:

Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The fair value of total purchase consideration is allocated to the fair values of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill. All assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. Estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from those estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. At the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the statements of operations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations.

Intangible Assets. Intangible assets primarily consist of existing technology, customer relationships, and trademarks obtained as a result of the acquisition on October 17, 2022. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized based on their pattern of economic benefit over their estimated useful lives and reviewed periodically for impairment. Our trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite life. The estimated useful life of the acquired technology is 15 years while the estimated useful life of the customer relationships is 5 years.

Impairment of Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, as of June 30, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. We consider qualitative factors including market conditions, legal factors, operating performance indicators, and competition, among others, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. In performing the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of its reporting unit to the carrying amount including the goodwill of the reporting unit. If the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. We performed our annual evaluation of goodwill on June 30, 2024. Based on the analysis, we did not recognize an impairment loss during the year ended June 30, 2024. Subsequent evaluations will be performed annually on June 30, per our policy.

Stock-based Compensation. Compensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees and nonemployees, including stock options, restricted stock awards, and warrants, in the statements of operation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. As necessary, our stock price at the date of grant was estimated using an acceptable valuation technique such as the probability-weighted expected return model. The fair value of stock options and warrants are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value of our class B common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for restricted stock awards with performance-based vesting conditions is calculated based on the number of awards that are expected to vest during the performance period if it is probable that the performance metrics will be achieved. Generally, measured compensation cost, net of actual forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.

Revenue Recognition. We generate revenues from sales of our products and recognize revenue as control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of shipment based on the contractual terms with our customers. We provide customer programs and incentive offerings, including growth incentives and volume-based incentives. These customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration. We include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved. This determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale, and expected sales volume forecasts as it relates to our volume-based incentives. This determination is updated every reporting period. For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, customer growth and volume-based incentives were minimal. Certain product sales include a 2-year manufacturer’s warranty that provides the customer with assurance that the product performs as intended. Such warranties are assurance-type warranties and are accounted for as contingencies under ASC 460-10.


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
