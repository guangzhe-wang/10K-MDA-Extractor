\. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in the section titled “Risk Factors.”

Results of Operations

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023

Revenues and Costs of Revenues

Negative gaming revenues for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were $(1,098,374) and $(36,789), respectively. Costs of gaming revenues for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were $1,320,380 and $46,820, respectively. The increase in gross gaming loss and negative gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2023 is as a result of increased sports betting during the current year as compared to the prior year when our operations commenced.

Operating Expenses

Salaries and wages of $4,358,140 were incurred during the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to $5,477,939 during the year ended June 30, 2023.

The $1,119,799 decrease is primarily due to large bonuses and severance payments made during 2023 to former employees as per their employment and termination agreements.

Included in the 2023 Salaries and wages are bonuses of $425,000 paid to Mr. Linss and $50,000 paid to Mr. Thomas, our former Chief Executive Officers, respectively, pursuant to their respective employment agreements, $269,000 to Mr. Linss for severance, excluding employer taxes, and non-cash compensation totaling $1,161,669 of which $894,000 was for 2,980,000 shares of Series C preferred stock granted to Mr. Linss per the terms of his employment agreement, $94,750 and $23,687 in vested incentive stock options for Mr. Thomas and Mr. Fidaleo, our former Chief Financial Officer, respectively, $1,030,593 paid to key employees upon successful acquisition of ZenSports, Inc., assets, and $149,231 in vested incentive stock options for all other employees and contractors were included in salaries and wages.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative costs for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were $2,834,698 and $1,880,658, respectively.

The $954,040 increase was primarily due to gaming license fees of $723,475 during 2024 compared to $119,881 in during 2023, which is due to the May 24, 2023 start of our gaming license and operations. Legal fees increased by $933,454 during the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to increased legal fees related to the ZenSports acquisition arbitration which was settled during the year. Accounting fees increased $239,859 during the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2023 due to the switch in independent registered accounting firms and the increase in fees related to catching up on filings with the SEC.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were $1,785,522 and $104,484, respectively.

The increase is principally related to amortizable costs of acquired assets and capitalized internally developed software being placed in service upon commencement of Sports Betting operations on June 8, 2023.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and Marketing for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were $3,517,265 and $276,783, respectively.

The $3,240,482 increase is principally related to promotional bonuses awarded to players beginning upon commencement of Sports Betting operations on June 8, 2023.

Other Expenses

Total other expenses for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were $15,471,313 and $3,456,490, respectively.

The $12,014,824 increase is primarily due to the increase in the change in fair value of the derivative liability of $8,561,998 during the year ended June 30, 2024. The derivative is related to a conversion feature associated with the line of credit and convertible debt which is remeasured each reporting period.

In addition, interest expense – related party for the year ended June 30, 2024 increased by $2,400,191 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was due to the increase in principal balance on the LOC during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Net Loss

Our net loss for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $30,385,693 and $11,337,876, respectively.

The significant increase in the net loss is primarily related to the commencement of our sports betting operations which went live on June 8, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts payable and accrued expenditures, and capital expenditures, including the costs associated with internally developed software and attaining Gaming licenses.

As of June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, we had total current assets of $1,245,426, and $1,549,684, a working capital deficit of $20,782,894, and $13,335,862, respectively.

Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2024, was $11,301,366 compared to $6,795,123, for the year ended June 30, 2023.

The $4,506,243 increase in negative operating cash flow from operations during the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, is principally the result of the $22,531,817 increase in net loss primarily related to an increase in net gaming loss of $2,335,146, a $1,141,779 increase in general and administrative costs, a $3,240,482 increase in Sales and Marketing costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $1,681,038. All increases are as a result of obtaining our gaming license in Tennessee in May 2023 and going live with our sports betting app in Tennessee in June 2023.

As a result of the commencement of our operations, our net cash flows provided by prepaid and other current assets increased by $1,883,717 during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the payments of prepaid annual gaming license and obtaining and prepaying a portion of cyber and E&O insurance in the year ended June 30, 2023.

Our cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $489,371 during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in legal and other professional fees. The increase in legal and professional fees is associated with the ZenSports arbitration and more filings with the Securities and Exchange commission than in the prior year. The increase in accounts payable is also due to our general and securities council having provided us with generous informal extended payment terms to support our start-up and growth, we do not know if or for how long they will continue to provide extended payment terms.

Our cash flows from accrued expenses related-party increased by $672,550 during 2024 compared to 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in accrued interest associated with the increase in related party borrowings on the LOC.

Our players balances increased by $178,812 during 2024 compared to 2023, as result of our going live with sports betting during June 2023.

Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended June 30, 2024, was $476,956 compared to $1,704,014 for the year ended June 30, 2023.

The decrease is principally related to the $750,000 cash paid in the prior year to acquire certain assets of ZenSports, Inc., the $339,741 decrease in cash paid for capitalized software during the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, and the investment of $135,837 in capitalized gaming license costs, primarily legal and professional fees associated with obtaining our gaming license from Tennessee during the prior year.

Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2024, was $11,872,689 compared to $8,788,292 for the year ended June 30, 2023.

The $3,084,397 increase in net cash provided from financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, was principally the result of the receipt of $11,660,000 in proceeds from the related party demand line of credit as compared to $3,685,338 during the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $2,467,500 in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2024 compared to 2023 as well as a decrease in proceeds from related party notes payable in the amount of $1,600,000.

As of September 15, 2022, we ceased all operations relating to our prior business and continued executing our business plan for our current business which began on June 16, 2022. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we executed our original business plan through January 10, 2023, at which time we replaced our CEO and commenced executing our revised business plan to solely focus on obtaining a gaming license in Tennessee and commencing sports betting revenues. We obtained our gaming license in May 2023 and on June 8, 2023 commenced sports betting operations.

Since our Current business has a limited history of generating revenues or operating successfully, we will be dependent upon, among other things, achieving a level of profitable operations and receiving additional cash infusions including securing additional lines of credit and raising additional capital through the placement of preferred and/or common stock in order to implement our business plan. Because of our limited operating history, it is difficult to predict our capital needs on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. We will have limited capital available to us if we are unable to raise money through private equity offerings or find alternate forms of financing.

On July 24, 2023, we issued a press release announcing the commencement of an offering of up to $10.0 million of the Company’s Common Stock, at a purchase price of $1.00 per share. To date we have not closed any of this financing and may not be able find a willing market. We continue to explore various avenues and forms of financing and to aggressively increase revenues. However, management has limited bandwidth, we are in a transitioning financial market, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital timely.

We expect our revenues to increase over time but we lack sufficient history to accurately forecast the amount or time required to generate sufficient revenues to cover our current or future burn rate.

We expect to incur significant increases in operating costs. The expected significant increases in costs will include, but not be limited to, costs relating to License maintenance, technology development and maintenance, sales and marketing, labor for both existing and new personnel, and other operating cost increases due to the current inflationary market place we operate in. The expected increase in operating costs is a byproduct of transitioning from a development stage business to a revenue generating operating business.

Going Concern

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had an accumulated deficit of $43,504,774 as of June 30, 2024. We had a net loss of $30,385,693 and negative cash flows of $11,301,366 from operations for the year ended June 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

As of September 15, 2022, we ceased all operations relating to our prior business and focused exclusively on our current business plan. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we executed our original business plan through January 10, 2023, at which time we replaced our CEO and commenced executing our revised business plan to solely focus on obtaining a gaming license in Tennessee and commencing sports betting revenues. We obtained our gaming license in May 2023 and went live with our sports betting app and commenced revenues in June 2023. Since our current business has a limited history of generating revenues or operating successfully, we will be dependent upon, among other things, achieving a level of profitable operations and receiving additional cash infusions including securing additional lines of credit and raising additional capital through the placement of preferred and/or common stock in order to implement our business plan. Because of our limited operating history, it is difficult to predict our capital needs on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. We will have limited capital available to us if we are unable to raise money through private equity offerings or find alternate forms of financing. On July 24, 2023, issued a press release announcing the commencement of an offering of up to $10.0 million of the Company’s Common Stock, at a purchase price of $1.00 per share. To date we have not closed any of this financing and may not be able find a willing market. We continue to explore various avenues and forms of financings and to aggressively increase revenues. We will be dependent upon, among other things, achieving a level of profitable operations and receiving additional cash infusions including securing additional lines of credit and raising additional capital through the placement of preferred and/or common stock in order to implement our business plan. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in order to continue as a going concern. We are funding our business operations by utilizing a related party demand line of credit, borrowing on short term related party demand notes payable, issuing preferred stock, and issuing common stock through private placements.

We cannot be certain that capital will be provided when it is required or in amounts sufficient to meet our operating requirements. Management believes the existing stockholders, the prospective new investors, and future sales will provide the additional cash needed to meet our obligations as they become due and will allow the development of our core business operations. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If adequate working capital is not available, we may not continue our operations.

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of June 30, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Emerging Growth Company Status

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

● | have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
---|--- 
● | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
● | submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and 
● | disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion; (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period; or (iv) June 30, 2026. Even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company, we may still be, in certain circumstances, subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company. For example, smaller reporting companies, like emerging growth companies, are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K or auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting.
