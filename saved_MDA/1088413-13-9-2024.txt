These statements concern Greystone's plans, expectations and objectives for future operations. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-K that address activities, events or developments that Greystone expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words "believe," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that Greystone believes are reasonable based on current expectations and projections about future events and industry conditions and trends affecting Greystone's business. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to Greystone's expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed under the section of this Form 10-K entitled "Risk Factors." In addition, Greystone's historical financial performance is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future and Greystone believes that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.

Results of Operations

General

The consolidated financial statements include Greystone and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Greystone Manufacturing, L.L.C. (“GSM”), and Plastic Pallet Production, Inc. (“PPP”), and one variable interest entity, Greystone Real Estate, L.L.C. (“GRE”). Effective July 29, 2022, GRE was no longer deemed to be a beneficiary of Greystone and, accordingly, was deconsolidated on the effective date as discussed further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Greystone's primary business is the manufacturing of plastic pallets utilizing recycled plastic and selling the pallets through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, GSM.

As of May 31, 2024 and 2023, Greystone had FTE’s of approximately 190 and 179 employees, respectively. Temporary personnel from a personnel service entity are utilized as needed. There were FTE’s of approximately 69 and 109 temporary personnel as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Greystone's in-house production capacity for its injection molding machines capable of producing pallets is approximately 225,000 plastic pallets per month, or 2,700,000 per year. Production levels will vary proportionately as a result of the pallet design, machine downtime or customer restrictions for maintaining stringent sizing on certain pallets.

Year Ended May 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended May 31, 2023

Sales

Sales were $61,780,715 for fiscal year 2024 compared to $60,758,962 for fiscal year 2023 representing an increase of $1,021,753, or about 2%. Fiscal year 2023 was a turn-around period to recover from declining sales as customers shied away from inflationary pricing during the pandemic period. As raw material pricing returned to relatively normal historic levels during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company focused its efforts on rebuilding relations with existing customers as well as seeking new customers.

Greystone’s major customers, varying from three to four, accounted for approximately 81% and 73% of total sales in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Customers that account for significant sales may vary in any one year. Generally, customers purchasing substantial quantities to replace or add pallets to their inventory consistently comprise a significant portion of sales. Any customer(s) needing a substantial quantity of pallets to fulfill a specific need may vary from year to year.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales was $50,065,085 (81% of sales) and $51,427,409 (85% of sales) in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the ratio of cost of sales to sales (the “ratio”) in fiscal year 2024 from fiscal year 2023 was the result of several factors, including a decline in the price of raw materials toward relatively historic levels.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $5,168,607, (8.4% of sales) for fiscal year 2024 compared to $5,100,170 (8.4% of sales) for fiscal year 2023, representing an increase of $68,437.

Gain on Involuntary Conversion

Gain on involuntary conversion was $593,647 for fiscal year 2024. In February 2024, one of the Company’s storage warehouses caught fire with damage to finished goods inventory valued at $1,326,752 and the building with a net book value of $161,850. The Company recorded an insurance receivable of $2,058,602 as an estimate for damage to the inventory and building, which resulted in a gain from the involuntary conversion of $593,647. The insurer and Company are currently reviewing and finalizing the claim value for the inventory. The Company will record any additional consideration once a settlement has been reached, which may increase the gain recorded in future periods.

Other Income (Expenses)

During fiscal years 2023, Greystone received $4,911,863, reimbursement from the Department of Treasury for refundable tax credits against certain employment taxes pursuant to the Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). There were no such credits recognized in 2024.

As a result of the deconsolidation of GRE in 2023, the Company recognized a gain of $569,997 in fiscal year 2023 which was attributable to a deferred gain from Greystone’s sell and leaseback of the building to GRE in the prior years.

Other income for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 included:

Interest expense was $1,291,054 in fiscal year 2024 compared to $1,189,034 in fiscal year 2023 for an increase of $99,903. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in the prime rate of interest which was 8.50% at May 31, 2024, compared to 8.25% at May 31, 2023.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $1,031,204 in fiscal year 2024 compared to $2,461,700 in fiscal year 2023. The effective tax rate differs from federal statutory rates due to state income taxes, charges which have no income tax benefit, changes in the valuation allowance, and changes in state income tax rates.

Based upon a review of its income tax filing positions, Greystone believes that its positions would be sustained upon an audit by the Internal Revenue Service and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.

Net Income

Net income was $5,027,491 in fiscal year 2024 compared to $6,388,108 in fiscal year 2023 for a decrease of $1,360,617 for the reasons discussed above.

Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders

After deducting preferred dividends and income attributable to non-controlling interests, the net income attributable to common stockholders was $4,440,265, or $0.16 per share, in fiscal year 2024 compared to $5,842,828, or $0.21 per share, in fiscal year 2023 for the reasons discussed above.

Greystone does not anticipate that it will make cash dividend payments to any holders of its common stock unless and until the financial position of Greystone improves through increased revenues, additional financing or otherwise. Further, pursuant to the terms and conditions of certain loan documentation with International Bank of Commerce, as discussed herein under the caption “Loans from International Bank of Commerce,” and the terms and conditions of Greystone's 2003 preferred stock, Greystone is restricted in its ability to pay dividends to holders of its common stock.
