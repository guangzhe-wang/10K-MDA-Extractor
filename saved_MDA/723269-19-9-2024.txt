ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATION 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

While the Company continues to evaluate business opportunities, its sole source of revenue is from the sale of marketable and non-marketable securities. Management has classified these securities as available for sale in accordance with ASC Topic 320, “Investments – Debt and Equity Securities.” These securities are recorded at fair value, and any unrealized gains and losses are reported as other comprehensive income. For securities for which there is an other-than-temporary impairment, an impairment loss is recognized as a realized loss.

Ironstone Property’s primary expenses are generated from maintaining regulatory reporting compliance, such as quarterly review and annual audit of the financial statements, seeking legal counsel when appropriate, and consulting fees.

Fair Value Measurements

The accounting principles general accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) defines fair value, establishes a framework that the Company uses to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures about the fair value measurements included in the Company's financial statements. Refer to Note 2 in the Notes to Financial Statements for these disclosures. Fair value is defined by GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date.

In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. GAAP establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company’s management. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect management’s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows:

Level 1–Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.

Level 2–Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3–Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

The availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022

Operating expenses for 2023 totaled $287,044 a decrease of $16,636 or 5% as compared to 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Professional fees from $33,698 in 2022 to $8,814 in 2021. Interest expense for fiscal year 2023 totaled $220,349, a decrease of $95,867 or 30% as compared to fiscal year 2022, which is attributed to a decrease in debt due the conversion of a promissory note to equity in 2022.

Net cash used in operating activities was $437,580 and $952,800 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities was zero and $200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease is due to a lack of capital available for such activities in 2023.

Given that the investment in TangoMe, Inc. does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company exerts significant judgment in estimating the fair value using various pricing models and the information available to the Company that it deems most relevant. The investment fair value was based in 2022 on using a Best-fit valuation for TangoMe Inc. as determined by the MESE big data analysis system and SPAC inquiries for TangoMe, Inc. In 2023, the Company used a third party valuation from Virtua, Inc. as its primary determinant of fair value. These are the primary significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s investment.
