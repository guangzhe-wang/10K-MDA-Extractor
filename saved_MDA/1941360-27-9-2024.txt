. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:

Results of Operation

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.

We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

Years Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:

The increase in revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the previous fiscal year, was due to the Company’s expanding operations and increased sales activities.

For the year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 operating expenses were $28,127 and $23,588, respectively. Operating expenses consist of mainly amortization expenses and general and administrative expenses. The increase in total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses which increased due to audit fees.

Our net loss for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $14,377 and $20,588, respectively. Net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, increased because the growth in revenue for the same period exceeded the growth in operating expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
