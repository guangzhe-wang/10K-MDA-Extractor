Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW 

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," as well as the information contained in "Risk Factors."

Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Executive Summary

We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.

In 2024, we continued to advance our key strategic initiatives in a challenging environment. We completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands, Inc. (Sovos Brands) which has brought incremental growth to our Meals & Beverages segment and supports the continued transformation of our advantaged portfolio. During 2024, we continued to navigate through a landscape marked by consumer behavior shifts, commodity cost fluctuations and other global macroeconomic challenges. During 2024, we experienced a moderate amount of input cost inflation and increased supply chain stability, which we expect to continue through 2025.

Strategy

Our strategy is to Set the Standard for performance in the food industry by driving accelerated growth in our two divisions within North America while delivering on the promise of our purpose - Connecting people through food they love. Our strategic framework is based on five areas that position us to achieve best in class performance: Top Team; Best Portfolio; Top-Tier Performance; Winning Execution; and Lasting Impact, as further discussed below.

•Top Team: We plan to continue our focus on creating a Top Team by fostering an engaged and inclusive culture, while building capabilities and developing leaders at all levels of the organization. We are driving organizational engagement, belonging and effectiveness through our employee value proposition: Make history with Campbell’s, and modernizing our facilities. We have completed the consolidation of our Snacks offices into Camden, New Jersey. Our single headquarters has helped to foster closer collaboration and enhance decision-making, thereby improving our ability to execute on our business strategy. 

•Best Portfolio: We believe that we are well-positioned as a transformative category leader with an advantaged portfolio of brands across our Meals & Beverages and Snacks segments. We will support our Best Portfolio priority and accelerate our profitable growth model by growing market share and driving integrated business planning programming throughout the company. 

•Top-Tier Performance: We also believe that we have the resources and capabilities to deliver predictable and consistent growth resulting in Top-Tier Performance through continued focus on effective revenue management, and finding innovative ways to enhance our products and processes to unlock cost efficiencies and savings across the enterprise.

•Winning Execution: We will focus on Winning Execution by delivering an advantaged supply chain by continuing to modernize our manufacturing and distribution network, with a focus on logistics and distribution expertise. We continued to pursue our multi-year cost savings initiatives with $950 million in cost savings achieved through 2024. On September 10, 2024, we announced plans to implement new cost savings initiatives beginning in 2025 with targeted annual savings of approximately $250 million by the end of 2028. See "Restructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives.

•Lasting Impact: Finally, we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose through a focus on Lasting Impact with continued progress on our sustainability and community goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate.

Business Trends

Our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: cost inflation; an evolving consumer landscape; and a competitive and dynamic retail environment.

Our strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume while also making more intentional decisions on value in snacking. We also expect consumers to continue in-home eating behaviors.

Retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including supplier-funded customized products. Any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote private label brands that compete with branded products, especially on price.

Our industry continues to navigate a steady and ongoing recovery in light of supply chain disruptions, commodity cost volatility, labor market issues, economic uncertainties regarding the 2024 presidential election, impacts of a potential change in administration and other global macroeconomic challenges. Throughout 2024, we have experienced some moderation in input cost inflation, and we expect input cost inflation in 2025 to remain at similar levels as 2024, as we continue to see improvement across certain ingredients and packaging materials. We anticipate continued supply chain productivity and previously implemented pricing actions to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures, and expect such benefits to offset incremental costs in 2025. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Business Acquisition & Divestiture

On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands for total purchase consideration of $2.899 billion.

On August 26, 2024, we completed the sale of our Pop Secret popcorn business. For additional information on the divestiture, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stock Exchange Listing

On August 19, 2024, our capital stock, par value $0.0375 per share (the Capital Stock), began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC following our voluntarily withdrawal from listing on the New York Stock Exchange after market close on August 16, 2024.

Summary of Results 

This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows. 

There were 52 weeks in 2024, 2023 and 2022. There will be 53 weeks in 2025.

•Net sales increased 3% in 2024 to $9.636 billion primarily due to a 5-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands and favorable net price realization, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.

•Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 30.8% in 2024 from 31.2% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, the impact of the acquisition and mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges, partially offset by the benefits from supply chain productivity improvements and favorable net price realization.

•Earnings per share were $1.89 in 2024, compared to $2.85 a year ago. The current year included expenses of $1.19 per share and the prior year included expenses of $.15 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below. 

Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2024 Compared with 2023

The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:

•We implemented several cost savings initiatives in recent years. In 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of $17 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $54 million in Administrative expenses, $26 million in Cost of products sold, $4 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $3 million in Research and development expenses related to these initiatives. In 2023, we recorded Restructuring charges of $16 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $24 million in Administrative expenses, $18 million in Cost of products sold, $5 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $3 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $50 million after tax, or $.17 per share) related to these initiatives. 

In the second quarter of 2024, we began implementation of a new optimization initiative to improve the effectiveness of our Snacks direct-store-delivery route-to-market network. In 2024, we recognized $5 million in Marketing and selling expenses related to this initiative.

In 2024, the total aggregate impact related to the cost savings and optimization initiatives was $109 million ($83 million after tax, or $.28 per share). See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives" for additional information;

•In 2024, we recognized actuarial losses on our pension and postretirement plans in Other expenses / (income) of $33 million ($25 million after tax, or $.08 per share). In 2023, we recognized actuarial gains in Other expenses / (income) of $15 million ($11 million after tax, or $.04 per share);

•In 2024, we recognized losses in Cost of products sold of $22 million ($16 million after tax, or $.05 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges. In 2023, we recognized gains in Cost of products sold of $21 million ($16 million after tax, or $.05 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges;

•In the first quarter of 2024, we announced our intent to acquire Sovos Brands and on March 12, 2024 the acquisition closed. In 2024, we incurred $126 million of costs associated with the acquisition, of which $21 million was recorded in Restructuring charges, $47 million in Administrative expenses, $35 million in Other expenses / (income), $3 million in Marketing and selling expenses, $2 million in Research and development expenses and $18 million in Cost of products sold, of which $17 million was associated with the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. We also recorded costs of $2 million in Interest expense related to costs associated with the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement (the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement) used to fund the acquisition. The aggregate impact was $128 million, $109 million after tax, or $.36 per share. In 2023, we incurred costs associated with the acquisition in Other expense / (income) of $5 million ($4 million after tax, or $.01 per share);

•In 2024, we recorded accelerated amortization expense in Other expenses / (income) of $27 million ($20 million after tax, or $.07 per share) related to customer relationship intangible assets due to the loss of certain contract manufacturing customers, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2023, we recorded accelerated amortization expense in Other expenses / (income) of $7 million ($5 million after tax, or $.02); 

•In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $53 million in Other expenses / (income) on certain salty snacks and cookie trademarks within our Snacks segment, including Tom's, Jays, Kruncher's, O-Ke-Doke, Stella D'oro and Archway, collectively referred to as our "Allied brands." In 2024, sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2024, based on recent performance and reevaluation of the position of the Allied brands within our portfolio, we lowered our near-term and long-term outlook for future sales and operating performance.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed an impairment assessment on the assets in our Pop Secret popcorn business within our Snacks segment as sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins, and as we pursued divesting the business. As a result of these factors, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we lowered our long-term outlook for the business and recognized an impairment charge of $76 million in Other expenses / (income) on the trademark. The sale of the business was completed on August 26, 2024.

The total aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $129 million ($98 million after tax, or $.33 per share). See "Critical Accounting Estimates" for additional information;

•In 2024, we recorded pre- and after-tax litigation expenses in Administrative expenses of $5 million ($.02 per share) related to the Plum baby food and snacks business (Plum), which was divested on May 3, 2021, and certain other litigation matters;

__________________________________________

Includes revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs.

Sum of the individual amounts does not add due to rounding.

In 2024, Meals & Beverages sales increased 7% reflecting a 9-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands. Sales were impacted by unfavorable volume/mix with neutral net price realization. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition, sales decreased primarily due to declines in U.S. retail products, including beverages and U.S. soup, partially offset by gains in foodservice and Canada. Sales of U.S. soup decreased 2% primarily due to decreases in ready-to-serve soups and condensed soups, partially offset by an increase in broth. On a two-year CAGR basis, sales increased 7%, including the impact of the acquisition.

In 2023, Meals & Beverages sales increased 7% primarily due to increases in U.S. retail products, including U.S. soup and Prego pasta sauces, as well as gains in foodservice. Favorable net price realization was partially offset by lower volume/mix. Sales of U.S. soup increased 3% primarily due to increases in ready-to-serve soups and broth.

In 2024, Snacks sales decreased 2%. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of the Emerald nuts business, sales decreased as declines in third-party partner brands and contract manufacturing, fresh bakery and Pop Secret popcorn were partially offset by sales of our power brands, which increased 2%. Sales of power brands were driven by increases in Goldfish crackers and Lance sandwich crackers. Volume/mix declines were partially offset by favorable net price realization. On a two-year CAGR basis, sales increased 5%. 

In 2023, Snacks sales increased 13% driven by sales of our power brands which increased 17%. Sales increased due to increases in cookies and crackers, primarily Goldfish crackers and Lance sandwich crackers, and in salty snacks, primarily Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels and Kettle Brand and Cape Cod potato chips. Sales benefited from favorable net price realization.

Gross Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $54 million in 2024 from 2023 and increased by $290 million in 2023 from 2022. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 30.8% in 2024, 31.2% in 2023 and 30.7% in 2022. 

The 40 basis-point decrease and the 50 basis-point increase in gross profit margin in 2024 and 2023, respectively, were due to the following factors:

__________________________________________

2024 includes an estimated positive margin impact of 20 basis points from the benefit of cost savings initiatives, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including a 40 basis-point negative impact from the change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges and a 10 basis-point negative impact from a cybersecurity incident. 2023 includes a 90 basis-point positive impact from the change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges and an estimated positive margin impact of 10 basis points from the benefit of cost savings initiatives, which were more than offset by cost inflation and other factors. 

Includes a negative margin impact of 20 basis points from a Sovos Brands acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. 

Includes the impact of operating leverage. 

Marketing and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 8.6% in 2024, 8.7% in 2023 and 8.6% in 2022. Marketing and selling expenses increased 3% in 2024 from 2023. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition (approximately 4 points), higher selling expenses (approximately 1 point) and higher other marketing expenses (approximately 1 point), partially offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 3 points), primarily in Meals & Beverages. 

Marketing and selling expenses increased 10% in 2023 from 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 7 points) and higher selling expenses (approximately 6 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 points). The increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense was due in part to moderated levels in the prior year from supply constraints.

Administrative Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.6% in 2024, 7.0% in 2023 and 7.2% in 2022. Administrative expenses increased 13% in 2024 from 2023. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition (approximately 7 points), higher costs related to cost savings initiatives (approximately 5 points), higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 3 points), the impact of the acquisition (approximately 2 points) and higher benefit-related costs (approximately 2 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 5 points) and lower incentive compensation (approximately 2 points).

Administrative expenses increased 6% in 2023 from 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 8 points) and higher incentive compensation (approximately 2 points), partially offset by lower expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims (approximately 4 points). Administrative expenses in 2023 included $14 million of litigation expenses related to the Plum baby food and snacks business, which we divested in May 2021.

An analysis of operating earnings by segment follows:

__________________________________________

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.

Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages increased 9% in 2024 versus 2023. The increase was primarily due the benefit of the acquisition of Sovos Brands and lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by lower gross profit. Gross profit margin decreased due to higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs and the dilutive impact of the acquisition, partially offset by supply chain productivity improvements, favorable net price realization and favorable volume/mix.

Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages increased 2% in 2023 versus 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin decreased due to unfavorable volume/mix, with favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements more than offsetting higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs.

Operating earnings from Snacks increased 1% in 2024 versus 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to supply chain productivity improvements, favorable net price realization and benefits from cost savings initiatives more than offsetting higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs. 

Operating earnings from Snacks increased 24% in 2023 versus 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable volume/mix.

•$44 million of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; and

•costs of $26 million related to the cost savings initiatives.

Excluding these amounts, the slight increase in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to higher net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income in the prior year, mostly offset by lower general and administrative expenses. Excluding these amounts, the remaining change in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income in 2023 and higher administrative expenses, including litigation expenses related to the Plum baby food and snacks business. 

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased to $249 million in 2024 from $188 million in 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher levels of debt to fund the acquisition and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio.

Interest expense decreased to $188 million in 2023 from $189 million in 2022. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4 million in 2022, partially offset by higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio.

Taxes on Earnings

The effective tax rate was 25.1% in 2024, 23.9% in 2023 and 22.4% in 2022.

The increase in the effective tax rate in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to nondeductible costs associated with the acquisition.

The increase in the effective rate in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to the favorable impact of state income tax law changes in 2022.

Restructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives

Multi-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance) Cost Transformation Program and Integration

Continuing Operations

Beginning in 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. 

Over the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure.

On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance.

In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continued to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

A summary of charges recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows:

A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with these initiatives is as follows:

Of the aggregate $895 million pre-tax costs incurred to date, approximately $720 million were cash expenditures. In addition, we invested $543 million in capital expenditures as of July 28, 2024. The capital expenditures primarily related to a U.S. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the Snyder’s-Lance manufacturing network, optimization of production within our Meals & Beverages manufacturing network, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications, implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, and optimization of the Snyder’s-Lance warehouse and distribution network. 

We funded the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.

Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with segments is as follows:

As of July 28, 2024, we have substantially completed the multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration, and we have generated total program-to-date pre-tax savings of approximately $950 million. Certain phases that have not been fully implemented will be incorporated into the new cost savings initiatives described below. 

Sovos Brands Integration Initiatives

On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. See Note 3 for additional information. We have identified opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands.

In 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of $21 million of severance pay and benefits related to initiatives to achieve the synergies and generated pre-tax savings of $10 million. The charges incurred in 2024 were associated with the Meals & Beverages segment. Beginning in 2025, the initiatives to achieve the synergies will be incorporated into the new cost savings initiatives described below.

2025 Cost Savings Initiatives

On September 10, 2024, we announced plans to implement new cost savings initiatives beginning in 2025, including initiatives to further optimize our supply chain and manufacturing network, optimization of our information technology infrastructure and targeted cost management. We also identified additional opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. As mentioned above, we substantially completed our existing multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain initiatives from that program have been incorporated into our new cost savings initiatives. Cost estimates for these new initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.

The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified to date are approximately $180 million and we expect to incur substantially all of the costs through 2028. These estimates will be updated as the detailed plans are developed. We expect the costs for the actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $25 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $45 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and $110 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 80%; Snacks - approximately 5% and Corporate - approximately 15%. Of the aggregate $180 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect $135 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $235 million in capital expenditures. We expect these initiatives, once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $250 million by the end of 2028.

Other Optimization Initiatives

In the second quarter of 2024, we began implementation of a new initiative to improve the effectiveness of our Snacks direct-store-delivery route-to-market network. Pursuant to this initiative we will purchase certain Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance routes where there are opportunities to unlock greater scale in select markets, combine them and sell the combined routes to independent contractor distributors. We expect to execute this program in a staggered rollout and to incur expenses of up to approximately $115 million through 2029. In 2024, we incurred $5 million in Marketing and selling expenses related to this initiative.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements. 

We generated cash flows from operations of $1.185 billion in 2024, compared to $1.143 billion in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to changes in working capital.

We generated cash flows from operations of $1.143 billion in 2023, compared to $1.181 billion in 2022. The decline in 2023 was primarily due changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. 

We had negative working capital of $1.386 billion as of July 28, 2024, and $161 million as of July 30, 2023. Current assets were less than current liabilities, which included debt maturing in one year, due to a focus on lowering core working capital requirements. Total debt maturing within one year was $1.423 billion as of July 28, 2024, and $191 million as of July 30, 2023. 

We have $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes maturing in March 2025 that we expect to repay and/or refinance using available sources, which may include cash on hand, accessing the capital markets, commercial paper and/or revolving credit facility.

As part of our focus to lower core working capital requirements, we have worked with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Amounts outstanding under these programs, which are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $243 million at July 28, 2024, and $258 million at July 30, 2023.

Capital expenditures were $517 million in 2024, $370 million in 2023 and $242 million in 2022. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $530 million in 2025. Capital expenditures in 2024 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business, upgrades of assets across both segments of the business, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey and network optimization for our Meals & Beverages business. Capital expenditures in 2023 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business and a new manufacturing line for our Meals & Beverages business. Capital expenditures in 2022 included improvement of the quality and cost structure of the Snyder's-Lance manufacturing network, the continued implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance and cookie and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business.

In Snacks, we have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. From time to time, we purchase and sell routes, including certain routes under our optimization initiatives. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities. 

On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. Cash consideration was $2.857 billion. The acquisition was funded through the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement of $2 billion and cash on hand.

On May 30, 2023, we completed the sale of our Emerald nuts business for $41 million.

Dividend payments were $445 million in 2024, $447 million in 2023 and $451 million in 2022. Annual dividends declared were $1.48 per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022. The 2024 fourth quarter dividend was $.37 per share. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.

In June 2021, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million (June 2021 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The June 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the anti-dilutive program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In 2024, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $67 million pursuant to our June 2021 program. As of July 28, 2024, approximately $37 million remained available under the June 2021 program and approximately $301 million remained under the September 2021 program. In 2023, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $142 million. In 2022, we repurchased 3.8 million shares at a cost of $167 million. In September 2024, the Board authorized a new anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million (September 2024 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The September 2024 program has no expiration date, but it may be discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2024 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Market for Registrant's Capital Stock, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for additional information.

On October 10, 2023, we entered into the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement totaling up to $2 billion scheduled to mature on October 8, 2024. Loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. The proceeds of the loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement could only be used in connection with the acquisition of Sovos Brands and the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. On March 12, 2024, we borrowed $2 billion under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement and used the proceeds in order to fund the acquisition of Sovos Brands, along with the fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.

In August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions. On March 19, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we issued senior unsecured notes of $2.5 billion, consisting of:

•$400 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.30% per annum, due March 20, 2026, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 20 and September 20 commencing September 20, 2024;

•$500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.20% per annum, due March 19, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 19 and September 19 commencing September 19, 2024;

•$600 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.20% per annum, due March 21, 2029, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024; and 

•$1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.40% per annum, due March 21, 2034, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024.

The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay the $2 billion of outstanding borrowings under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement used to fund the Sovos Brands acquisition, including fees and expenses in connection therewith, and the remainder of the net proceeds to repay commercial paper.

On November 15, 2022, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $500 million scheduled to mature on November 15, 2025. Loans under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. We borrowed $500 million under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement on March 13, 2023, and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the 3.65% $566 million Notes that matured on March 15, 2023. On April 5, 2024, we repaid $100 million of the $500 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement.

On April 16, 2024, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility dated September 27, 2021 (as amended on April 4, 2023). On April 16, 2024, we entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement for an unsecured, senior revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1.85 billion with a maturity date of April 16, 2029, or such later date as extended pursuant to the terms set forth in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement remained unused at July 28, 2024, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. We may increase the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement commitments up to an additional $500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Loans under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement facility contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.25:1.00 and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.

As of July 28, 2024, we had $1.423 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $250 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of July 28, 2024, we issued $28 million of standby letters of credit.

We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

Contractual Obligations

We have short- and long-term material cash requirements related to our contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations, our contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase commitments, lease payments and pension and postretirement benefits.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our principal payments for short-term borrowings and long-term debt obligations as of July 28, 2024. Interest payments primarily for short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of July 28, 2024 are approximately as follows: $319 million in 2025; $476 million in 2026 through 2027; $348 million in 2028 through 2029; and $1.336 billion from 2030 through maturity. Interest payments are based on principal amounts and coupons or contractual rates at fiscal year end.

Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment, contract manufacturing and services. As of July 28, 2024, purchase commitments totaled approximately $1.879 billion. Approximately $1.303 billion of these purchase commitments will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next 12 months and the balance of $576 million from 2026 through 2031.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our lease obligations as of July 28, 2024.

As of July 28, 2024, we have a pension liability of $103 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $145 million. As of July 28, 2024, we also have a pension asset of $143 million based on the funded status of certain plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Critical Accounting Estimates" for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

We guarantee approximately 4,700 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $522 million as of July 28, 2024. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.

These obligations and commitments impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY

The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward and option contracts. We enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and we may utilize interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, soybean oil, natural gas, cocoa, aluminum, corn and soybean meal. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. 

The information below summarizes our market risks associated with significant financial instruments as of July 28, 2024. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13, 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar and Euro, related to intercompany transactions and third-party transactions. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts and option contracts to hedge these exposures. The notional amounts of the contracts as of July 28, 2024, and July 30, 2023, were $297 million and $140 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a gain of $2 million as of July 28, 2024, and a loss of 

$1 million as of July 30, 2023. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts by approximately $16 million as of July 28, 2024, and $17 million as of July 30, 2023, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.

As of July 28, 2024, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $650 million with an average interest rate of 6.20%. As of July 30, 2023, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $678 million with an average interest rate of 6.18%. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in average interest rates applied to our variable-rate debt balances throughout 2024 and 2023 would have increased annual interest expense in those years by approximately $7 million and $4 million, respectively.

As of July 28, 2024, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $6.584 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%. As of July 30, 2023, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $4.041 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.79%. The fair value of fixed-rate debt was $6.216 billion as of July 28, 2024 and $3.615 billion as of July 30, 2023. As of July 28, 2024, and July 30, 2023, a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $312 million and $221 million, respectively, while a hypothetical 100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $348 million and $256 million, respectively. The impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.

We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We manage our exposure to interest volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts to hedge the rate on the interest payments related to the anticipated debt issuance. There were no forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts outstanding as of July 28, 2024 and July 30, 2023. We settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.1 billion in March 2024 at a loss of $11 million. The $11 million loss on these instruments was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized as additional interest expense over the 10-year, 5-year, and 3-year lives of the debt issued in March 2024. Subsequent to July 28, 2024, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps accounted for as cash-flow hedges with a notional value of $450 million related to an anticipated debt issuance. The forward starting interest rate swaps mature in January 2025.

We enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts, and a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. As of July 28, 2024, the total notional amount of the contracts was $248 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $10 million. As of July 30, 2023, the total notional amount of these contracts was $241 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $11 million. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices would impact the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts by approximately $24 million as of July 28, 2024, and $25 million as of July 30, 2023, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.

We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. The notional amount of the contracts was $71 million as of July 28, 2024, and $42 million as of July 30, 2023. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $3 million as of July 28, 2024, and a gain of $4 million as of July 30, 2023. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in equity price changes would impact the fair value of our outstanding swap contracts by $7 million as of July 28, 2024, and $5 million as of July 30, 2023, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: 

Trade and consumer promotion programs — We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The mix between these forms of variable consideration, which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. Differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and 

performance were to vary from estimates. Accrued trade and consumer promotion liabilities as of July 28, 2024 and July 30, 2023 were $186 million and $156 million, respectively.

Valuation of long-lived assets — Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable. If impairment is determined to exist, the charge is calculated based on estimated fair value.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill in the reporting unit.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.

As of July 28, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill was $5.077 billion. which included $1.116 billion from the acquisition of Sovos Brands. The carrying values of the reporting units associated with the Sovos Brands acquisition approximate fair value. Based on our assessments, all of our reporting units excluding the reporting units associated with the Sovos Brands acquisition had fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values. 

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $53 million on certain salty snacks and cookie trademarks within our Snacks segment, including Tom’s, Jays, Kruncher’s, O-Ke-Doke, Stella D’oro and Archway, collectively referred to as our "Allied brands." In 2024, sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2024, based on recent performance and the reevaluation of the position of the Allied brands within our portfolio, we lowered our near-term and long-term outlook for future sales and operating performance. As of July 28, 2024, the carrying value of the Allied brands trademark was $43 million.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed an impairment assessment on the assets in our Pop Secret popcorn business within our Snacks segment as sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins, and as we pursued divesting the business. As a result of these factors, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we lowered our long-term outlook for the business and recognized an impairment charge of $76 million on the trademark. As of July 28, 2024, the carrying value of the trademark was $28 million. The sale of the business was completed on August 26, 2024.

As of July 28, 2024, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $3.882 billion as detailed below:

_____________________________________

Associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance and includes the Pop Secret and Allied brands trademarks.

The $1.47 billion carrying value of the Rao's trademark associated with the Sovos Brands acquisition approximates fair value. Holding all other assumptions used in the acquisition valuation measurement constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce the fair value of this trademark and result in impairment charges of approximately:

Excluding the Rao's trademark and the Pop Secret trademark, which was sold on August 26, 2024, as of the 2024 annual impairment testing, indefinite-lived trademarks with approximately 10% or less of excess coverage of fair value over carrying value had an aggregate carrying value of $1.293 billion and included the Snyder's of Hanover, Pace, Pacific Foods and certain other Snacks trademarks. Although assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation, sensitivities to changes are provided below. Holding all other assumptions in our 2024 impairment testing constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:

While the 1% changes in assumptions would not result in impairment charges on our other trademarks, some changes would reduce the excess coverage of fair value over carrying value to less than 10% for the Cape Cod trademark.

The estimates of future cash flows used in impairment testing are made at a point in time, involve considerable management judgment, and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, assumed royalty rates, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions. If our assumptions change or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. 

See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.

Pension and postretirement benefits — We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.

In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. We use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows.

The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. 

As of July 28, 2024, we have a pension liability of $103 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $145 million. As of July 28, 2024, we also have a pension asset of $143 million based on the funded status of certain plans.

Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense (income) and actuarial losses (gains) included within net periodic pension and benefit expense (income) were as follows:

The actuarial losses recognized in 2024 were primarily due to decreases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation and plan experience, partially offset by gains on plan assets. The actuarial gains recognized in 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation, partially offset by losses on plan assets and plan experience. The actuarial losses recognized in 2022 were primarily due to losses on plan assets, partially offset by increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation.

Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:

Based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of July 28, 2024, estimated sensitivities to 2025 annual net periodic pension and postretirement cost are as follows: 

•a 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate would result in expense of approximately $5 million and would result in an immediate actuarial gain recognition of approximately $43 million; 

•a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would result in income of approximately $5 million and would result in an immediate actuarial loss recognition of approximately $47 million; and 

•a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would result in expense of approximately $6 million.

Contributions to pension plans were not material in 2024, 2023 and 2022 and are not expected to be material in 2025.

See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits.

Income taxes — The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

See also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

This Report contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding our future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "pursue," "strategy," "target," "will" and similar expressions. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and may reflect anticipated cost savings or implementation of our strategic plan. These statements reflect our current plans and expectations and are based on information currently available to us. They rely on several assumptions regarding future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.
