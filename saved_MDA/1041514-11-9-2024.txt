MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 

RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS 

The following

discussion and

analysis should

be read

in conjunction

with Item

8—“Financial Statements

and Supplementary 

Data.” In

addition

to historical

consolidated

financial

information,

the following

discussion

and

analysis contains

forward-looking 

statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See Item 1A—

“Risk Factors” and “Forward Looking Statements.” 

U.S. securities laws

require that when

we publish any

non-GAAP measures, we

disclose the reason

for using these

non-GAAP 

measures

and

provide

reconciliations

to

the

most

directly

comparable

GAAP

measures.

We

discuss

why

we

consider

it

useful

to 

present these non-GAAP

measures and the

material risks and

limitations of these

measures, as well

as a reconciliation

of these non-

GAAP measures

to the

most directly

comparable GAAP

financial measure

below at

“—Results of Operations

—Use of Non-GAAP 

Measures” below. 

Overview

We

offer a wide

range of solutions

including transactional

accounts (banking), lending,

insurance, cash management

solutions, 

card acceptance, supplier payments, software services

and bill payments. By providing

a full-service fintech platform in

our connected 

ecosystem, we facilitate the digitization of commerce in our markets. 

Sources of Revenue

We

generate our

revenues by

charging

transaction fees

to merchants,

financial service

providers, utility

providers, bill

issuers 

and consumers; by selling airtime to merchants;

by providing loans to merchants and consumers,

and insurance products to consumers 

and by selling hardware, licensing software and providing related technology

services to merchants. 

We act

as a service provider whereby we

own and operate the technology and

apply it in a system ourselves,

charging one-time 

and

ongoing fees

for

the use

of the

system either

on a

fixed or

ad valorem

basis. For

instance,

through

Connect,

we provide

cash 

management

and payment

services to

merchant

customers

through

a digital

vault which

is located

at the

customer’s

premises and 

generate processing revenue from

the provision of

these services. We also offer merchant customers

access to platforms through

which 

we (a)

generate revenue

from the

sale of

prepaid airtime

and (b)

generate fees

from distribution

of VAS,

including prepaid

airtime, 

prepaid electricity,

gaming voucher,

and other

services, to

users of

our platforms.

We

also generate

fees from

debit and

credit card 

transaction processing and interest revenue from qualifying merchant customers who are able to access short-term loans. The revenue 

and

costs

associated

with

these

services

and

sales

are

included

in

our

merchant

operating

segment.

We

also

generate

fees

from 

consumers utilizing our ATM

network. 

We

provide consumers with

bank accounts from

which we generate

a monthly fee

and also charge

fees on an ad

valorem basis 

for goods

and services

purchased. Usage

of our

bank accounts

also provides

our customers

with access

to short-term

loans and

life 

insurance products. The revenue and costs associated with this approach are

reflected in our consumer operating segment. 

Developments during Fiscal 2024 

This item

generally discusses

our 2024

results compared

to our

2023 results.

Discussions of

our 2023

results compared

to our 

2022 results can be found within our Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended June 30, 2023. 

Fiscal 2024 represents

a transformative year for

Lesaka. The continuation of

our strong and consistent

performance delivered a 

robust improvement

in profitability,

and we believe

the anticipated completion

of the Adumo

acquisition, announced

in fiscal 2024, 

will facilitate

an acceleration

of our

organic

growth story

and cement

Lesaka’s

position as

Southern

Africa’s

leading Fintech.

The 

consistent strengthening in our financial position enables us to continue

pursuing our organic and inorganic growth strategies.

Operating income of $3.6 million (ZAR 67.3 million) improved $18.9 million (ZAR

342.6 million) compared with an operating 

loss of

$15.3 million

(ZAR 275.3

million) during

fiscal 2023.

We

reported a

net loss

attributable to

the company

of $17.4

million 

(ZAR 326.1

million) during fiscal 2024 compared with a net loss of $35.1 million (ZAR 629.2

million) during fiscal 2023. 

We

achieved our

Group Adjusted

EBITDA guidance,

a non-GAAP

measure, delivering

$36.9 million

(ZAR 690.9

million) in 

fiscal 2024,

a 55%

increase in

ZAR, compared

to $24.8

million (ZAR

445.5

million) during

fiscal 2023,

demonstrating consistent 

execution against our growth strategy.

Refer to reconciliation below at “—Results

of Operations—Use of Non-GAAP Measures”

for 

a reconciliation

of Group

Adjusted EBITDA.

The continued

resilience of

our business

model in

a challenging

environment for

our 

merchant and consumer customers demonstrates the value our customers

place on our services. 


Our mission

at Lesaka

is to

provide

financial services,

including software,

to Southern

Africa’s

underserviced consumers

and 

merchants, improving people’s lives and

increasing financial inclusion in the markets in which we operate.

We achieved this through 

our ability to efficiently digitalize commerce by providing a full-service fintech platform and facilitating the secular shift from cash to 

digital that is currently taking place.

Merchant Division

The year-on-year growth achieved

by our Merchant

Division (“Merchant”) is

supported by the

robust secular trends

underpinning 

financial

inclusion,

cash management

and

digitalization

to empower

micro-merchants,

merchants

and

enterprise

clients to

transact 

efficiently and fulfill their potential. 

Performance in Merchant has been driven by: 

●

Our 

VAS

and supplier payments

business continues to see adoption by micro-merchants.

2024 includes approximately 6,400 devices attributable to the acquisition of Touchsides,

effective May 01, 2024, which are 

not enabled for VAS

and supplier payments on the Kazang platform.

o

We

had

approximately

87,500 devices

deployed

at June

30, 2024,

representing

a 17%

year-on-year

growth 

compared to approximately 75,000

devices one year ago, and

represents a 2-year CAGR of

31% compared to 

June 30, 2022. 

o

The 87,500 devices

includes approximately 2,300 Touchsides merchants with

devices already enabled for

VAS 

and

supplier

payments

on

the

Kazang

platform

and

an

additional

6,400

Touchsides

devices

which

are

not 

enabled

for

VAS

and

supplier

payments

on

the

Kazang

platform.

These

6,400

sites

present

an

immediate 

opportunity to deploy a Kazang device enabling VAS

sales and supplier payments. 

o

Core to our device placement strategy

is the decision to focus on

quality business and optimizing our

existing 

fleet, which is reflected in a healthy throughput growth and margin

per device. 

o

As previously

communicated,

our

product

mix for

VAS

and supplier

payment

sales has

changed

with low-

margin

money transfers

reducing significantly

due to

a change

in the

regulatory environment

impacting the 

industry as a

whole. Money

transfers comprised

7% of VAS

and supplier

payment throughput

in fiscal 2024 

compared to 22% in

fiscal 2023. This change

has had limited impact

on profitability as money

transfers are a 

very low margin product. 

o

VAS

and supplier

payments throughput,

excluding the low-margin

money transfers,

increased 43%

year-on-

year to ZAR 30.6 billion, and represents a 2-year CAGR of 49% compared

to June 30, 2022. 

o

Whilst we saw growth in our traditional

VAS

products of electricity,

airtime and gaming, much of the growth 

has

been

driven

by

the

uptake

of

our

supplier

payments

platform

by

micro-merchants.

As

we

bring

more 

suppliers onto our platform,

we anticipate these volumes

will continue to grow.

Supplier payment throughput 

volumes increased 124%

in fiscal 2024

compared to fiscal 2023

and now accounts

for approximately 35%

of 

our VAS

throughput volumes, compared to approximately 20% a year ago. 

o

Touchsides was acquired

at the end of April 2024 (refer below).

reflective

of

conditions,

o

We

continue

to

see

demand

for

our

merchant

lending

offering

however

the

deteriorating

performance

and 

financial strength of many

of our merchants means they

do not meet our credit

criteria, resulting in fewer and 

smaller extensions.

Whilst strict

application of

our credit

criteria has

led to

negative growth,

it has

protected 

and maintained the quality of our book through this cycle. Growth in credit disbursed and the Capital Connect 

loan book size at the end of the year represents a 2-year CAGR of 9% and 11%

respectively.

o

Capital

Connect’s

lending

proposition

is

an

important

component

in

enabling

the

merchants

we

serve

to 

compete and

grow.

Since inception,

Capital Connect

has distributed

more than

ZAR 3

billion of

funding to 

merchants and can provide funding

of up to ZAR 5

million in under 24 hours. Quick

access to affordable and 

flexible opportunity

capital is

vital in

every stage

of a

merchants’ lifecycle,

enabling them

to never

miss an 

opportunity.

o

In fiscal 2024 Capital

Connect launched 

“Fuel Connect”

, a tailored lending

solution addressing complexities 

in fuel ordering, aimed at solving for merchants’ pain points. 

o

Kazang Pay

Advance, our

lending offering

in the micro

-merchant sector,

was suspended

in early fiscal


following the decision to discontinue

the current product, especially in

the high interest rate environment. We 

continued

to

explore

other

options

with

respect

to

this

offering

with

it

now

in

live

pilot

phase.

We

are 

monitoring payment

behavior on a

smaller loan book

and applying stricter

lending criteria before

the official 

relaunch later in fiscal 2025.

Our cash

robust

in

sector

(Cash

are building

in

the

micro-merchant

sector

(Kazang

which

enables

our

merchant

customer

base

to 

significantly mitigate their operational risks pertaining to cash management

and security.

o

Whilst there

is trend

towards digital payments,

cash remains

as the

most significant portion

of retail transactions 

especially in informal markets. This business is

primarily exposed to the mid-market SMEs, a

sector which has 

experienced

challenges such

as power

outages,

high

price inflation

and

a slowdown

in consumer

spending, 

over

the

past


months.

This

impacted

the

merchants

we

serve

in

this

sector

and

resulted

in

increased 

bankruptcies and vault upliftments which affected

the net growth in the vault estate. 

o

Our merchants deposited over ZAR 113 billion in cash into our vaults in fiscal 2024 evidencing the value they 

derive from our ability to digitalize this cash and immediately provide access to working

capital.

Acquisition of Touchsides 

In February 2024

we announced the acquisition

of Touchsides

(Pty) Ltd (“Touchsides”)

and the deal

closed on April 30,

2024\. 

Touchsides

is a leading

data analytics and

insights company,

and highly

complementary with

our Kazang

business. The

acquisition 

significantly expands

Kazang’s

footprint in

the informal

market by

adding an

established solution

that has

a strong

presence in

the 

licensed tavern market. The business

provides platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”) and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions

to licensed 

tavern

outlets,

enabling

the

measurement

of

sales

activity

in

real-time,

management

of

stock

levels

and

informing

commercial 

decisions, such as pricing and promotional offers. 


The data and insights gathered from these terminals carries significant value and potential to be monetized through relationships 

with

a

range

of

clients

including

fast-moving

consumer

goods

companies,

retailers,

wholesalers,

route-to-market

suppliers,

and 

financiers. 

Touchsides is managed

as part of our micro-merchant business and has been allocated to our Merchant operating

segment.

Acquisition of Adumo

In May 2024

we announced the acquisition

of Adumo RF (Pty)

Ltd (“Adumo”), which

is subject to shareholder

and regulatory 

approvals.

Adumo is an independent

payments and commerce enablement

platform in Southern Africa,

serving approximately 23,000 active 

merchants with

operations across

South Africa,

Namibia, Botswana

and Kenya.

For more

than two

decades, Adumo

has facilitated 

physical and online commerce between retail merchants and end-consumers by offering

a unique combination of payment processing 

and integrated software

solutions, which currently

include embedded payments,

integrated payments, reconciliation services,

merchant 

lending, customer engagement tools, card issuing program management

and data analytics.

Adumo operates

across three

businesses, which

provide payment

processing and

integrated software

solutions to

different 

end markets: 

●

The Adumo

Payments business offers

payment processing,

integrated payments

and reconciliation

solutions to small-

and-medium

(“SME”)

merchants

in

South

Africa,

Namibia

and

Botswana,

and

also

provides

card

issuing

program 

management to corporate clients such as Anglo American and Coca-Cola; 

●

The Adumo ISV business, also known as GAAP,

has operations in South Africa, Botswana and Kenya, and clients in a 

further 21

countries, and

is the

leading provider

of integrated

point-of-sales software

and hardware

to the

hospitality 

industry in Southern Africa, serving clients such as KFC, McDonald’s,

Pizza Hut, Nando’s and Krispy Kreme;

and,

●

The Adumo

Ventures

business offers

online commerce

solutions (Adumo

Online), cloud-based,

multi-channel point-

of-sales

solutions

(Humble)

and

an

aggregated

payment

and

credit

platform

for

in-store

and

online

commerce 

(SwitchPay) to SME merchants and corporate clients in South Africa and Namibia.

Adumo generates

the majority

of its

revenue from

per transaction

fees that

are calculated

as a

percentage of

transaction value, 

and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) subscription fees charged to

merchants. As of June

30, 2024, Adumo employed approximately


employees throughout Southern Africa. 

The

acquisition

continues

Lesaka’s

consolidation

in

the

Southern

African

fintech

sector.

The

Lesaka

ecosystem

will

serve 

approximately 1.7 million

active consumers,

120,200 merchants,

and processes

over ZAR

270 billion

in throughput

(cash, card

and 

VAS)

per year.

The

combined

Group

will

have

over

3,300

employees

operating

on

the

ground

in

five

countries:

South

Africa,

Namibia, 

Botswana, Zambia, and Kenya. 

The acquisition enhances Lesaka's strengths in both the consumer

and merchant markets. 

The purchase

consideration will

be settled

through the

combination of

an issuance

of 17,279,803

shares of

our common

stock 

and a ZAR 232 million ($12.5

million, translated at the prevailing rate of

$1: ZAR 18.5 as of

May 6, 2024) payment in cash.

The share 

issuance

was

based

off

of

the

Base

Purchase

Consideration,

as

defined

in

the

transaction

agreement,

of

ZAR

1.59

billion 

($85.9 million),

less

the

ZAR


million

cash

payment,

implying

a

value

per

share

of

$4.25

((ZAR

1.59

billion

–

ZAR

0.232 

billion)/17,279,803 /

ZAR 18.5). Adumo

shareholders include Apis

Growth Fund I,

a private equity

fund managed by

Apis Partners 

LLP (“Apis”), African Rainbow

Capital (“ARC”), the largest

shareholder of Crossfin Holdings

(RF) Pty Ltd (“Crossfin”),

as well as 

the International Finance Corporation and Adumo management. 

As of September 11, 2024, the majority of shareholder and regulatory approvals required in finalizing this transaction have been 

satisfied. The transaction is expected

to close by October 2024 (quarter two

of fiscal 2025) once the remaining procedural

customary 

closing conditions are satisfied. 


Consumer Division 

In

our

Consumer

The progress on our key initiatives is as follows: 

●

Driving customer acquisition 

o

Gross

EPE

account

activations,

for

the

permanent

base,

during

fiscal


showed

significant

year-on-year 

improvement due

to various strategic

initiatives. We

achieved approximately

326,000 gross account

activations in 

the year, increasing

75% compared to approximately

186,000 in fiscal 2023.

After accounting for churn, net

active 

account growth for the year increased 143%

to approximately 192,000 accounts, compared to approximately 79,000 

in fiscal 2023. 

o

Our

total

active EPE

transactional

account base

stood

at

approximately

1.47 million

at

the end

of June

2024,

of 

which approximately

1.33 million

(or approximately

87%) are

permanent grant

recipients. The

balance comprises 

Social Relief of Distress

(“SRD”) grant recipients, which was

introduced during the COVID pandemic and

extended 

in calendar year 2023. 

o

Our priority

is to grow

our permanent

grant recipient

customers base,

where we

can build

deeper relationships

by 

offering other products such as insurance and lending. We do not offer the same breadth of service to the SRD grant 

base due to the temporary nature of the grant. 

●

Progress on cross

selling 

EasyPay Loans

o

We

originated approximately

1.06 million

loans during

the year

with our

consumer loan

book, before

allowances 

(“gross book”), increasing

32% to ZAR 548

million as of June

30, 2024, compared

to ZAR 415 million

as of June 

30, 2023. 

o

We have not

amended our credit scoring or other lending criteria and the growth is reflective of the demand

for our 

tailored

loan

product

for

this

market,

growth

in

EPE

bank

account

customer

base

and

improved

cross-selling 

capabilities. 

o

The

loan

conversion

rate continues

to improve

following

the implementation

of

a number

of targeted

Consumer 

lending campaigns and encouraging results from our digital channels during

the year. 

o

The portfolio loss ratio

of approximately 6%,

calculated as the loans

written off during

fiscal 2024 as a percentage 

of the total gross

loan book at the

end of the period,

remained stable on an

annualized basis, compared to

fiscal 2023. 


EasyPay Insurance

o

Our funeral

insurance product continued

its strong growth

and is a

material contributor

to the improvement

in our 

overall ARPU. We

have been able to improve customer

penetration to approximately 33% of our

active permanent 

grant account base

as of

June 30, 2024,

compared to approximately

31% as

of June 30,

2023\. Approximately 170,000 

new policies were

written during

fiscal 2024, increasing

37%, compared

to approximately

124,000 in

fiscal 2023. 

The

total

number

of

active

policies

has

grown

by

31%

to

approximately

439,000

policies

as

of

June

30,

2024, 

compared to June 30, 2023. 

ARPU

o

ARPU

for

our

permanent

client

base

has

increased

to

approximately

ZAR


as

of

June

30,

2024,

from 

approximately ZAR 80 as of June 30, 2023.

Economic Environment and Impact of loadshedding 

The economic environment in South Africa remains challenging for our consumer and merchant customers. Whilst inflation

has 

come down

into the top

end of the

Reserve Bank’s

target range,

the impact of

the past two

year’s high

inflationary and interest

rate 

environment has

impacted consumers.

Likewise, our

merchant customers

have operated

in a challenging

environment, especially

in 

the

formal

SME

segment

where

we

have

seen

the

impact

in

our

cash

and

lending

business.

Notwithstanding

the

challenges,

our 

business model

has proved

resilient, and

we have

managed to

continue growing

our consumer

and merchant

base whilst

delivering 

improved Group Adjusted EBITDA. 

Recent developments have bolstered confidence in our economy.

Whilst, as of the date of this Annual Report, the Reserve Bank 

has not reduced interest rates, there is a

possibility that a downward cycle in interest rates will

start soon. Power cuts, or loadshedding, 

has seen a marked improvement compared to last year. South Africa recently went through more than 100 days without loadshedding. 

The lead up to the

national elections in May 2024 was

a period of significant uncertainty for

South Africa. The eventual outcome, with 

a Government of National Unity being formed, was positively received by

the market, with the stock exchange reaching record highs 

and the bond market recording record inflows, reflecting renewed confidence. 

Overall,

the

South

African

economy

remains

challenging

with

high

unemployment,

high

interest

rates

and

low

growth 

expectations. We do not foresee

any major changes

however anticipate that

a lower interest

rate environment would

bring much needed 

relief to consumers and merchants in South Africa. 

Improvement in our Broad Based Black Economic

Empowerment (“B-BBEE”) rating to level 4 

B-BBEE is

a key

strategic priority

for us. Achievement

of B-BBEE

objectives is

measured by

a scorecard

which establishes

a 

weighting

for

various

elements.

Scorecards

are

independently

reviewed

by

accredited

BEE

verification

agencies

which

issue

a 

certificate that presents an entity’s BEE Contributor Status Level, with

level 1 being the highest

and “no rating” (a level

below level 8) 

as the lowest. During fiscal 2023, we made

significant progress in terms of improving our empowerment credentials and

in September 

2023 we

reported that

our independently

verified B-BBEE

rating improved

to a

level 5

rating from

a level

8 rating,

simultaneously 

setting out our aim to achieve a level 4 rating by the end of fiscal year 2024.

Together with various B-BBEE initiatives and programmes being rolled

out, including our Youth Employment Services (“YES”) 

programme, we

achieved this

target during

the second

quarter of

fiscal 2024

and have

received an

independently verified

B-BBEE 

rating of level 4. 

Leadership Changes in fiscal 2024 

On February 29, 2024 Mr. Chris Meyer completed his tenure as

Group CEO of Lesaka, a position he

held since July 1, 2021. Mr. 

Ali Mazanderani

took

over

the majority

of

Mr.

Meyer’s

responsibilities

as Executive

Chairman

of Lesaka

on

March 1,

2024.

Ali 

Mazanderani has been integral to the development of Lesaka’s strategy and has been a Non-Executive Director since 2020. As part of 

the change

in leadership,

Mr.

Kuben Pillay,

stepped down

as our

Chairman on

January 31,

2024, and

commenced his

role as

Lead 

Independent Director of Lesaka on February 1, 2024.


Critical Accounting Policies

Our audited consolidated

financial statements have

been prepared in accordance

with U.S. GAAP,

which requires management 

to

make

estimates

and

assumptions

about

future

events

that

affect

the

reported

amount

of

assets

and

liabilities

and

disclosure

of 

contingent assets and liabilities.

As future events and

their effects cannot be

determined with absolute certainty,

the determination of 

estimates requires

management’s

judgment based

on a

variety of

assumptions and

other determinants

such as

historical experience, 

current

and

expected

market

conditions

and

certain

scientific

evaluation

techniques.

Management

believes

that

the

following 

accounting policies

are critical due

to the degree

of estimation required

and the impact

of these policies

on the understanding

of the 

results of our operations and financial condition. 

Business Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill

A significant component

of our growth

strategy is to acquire

and integrate businesses

that complement

our existing operations. 

The purchase

price of

an acquired

business is

allocated to

the tangible

and intangible

assets acquired

and liabilities

assumed

based 

upon their estimated

fair value at the

date of purchase.

The difference between

the purchase price and

the fair value of

the net assets 

acquired is

recorded as goodwill.

In determining

the fair value

of assets acquired

and liabilities assumed

in a business

combination, 

we use various

recognized valuation methods, including

present value modeling.

Further, we make assumptions

using certain valuation 

techniques, including discount rates and timing of future cash flows.

We review the carrying value of goodwill annually

or more frequently if circumstances indicating impairment have occurred. In 

performing this review,

we are required to estimate

the fair value of goodwill that

is implied from a valuation of

the reporting unit to 

which the goodwill

has been allocated

after deducting the

fair values of

all the identifiable

assets and liabilities

that form part

of the 

reporting

unit.

The determination

of

the fair

value

of a

reporting

unit requires

us

to

make

significant

judgments

and estimates.

In 

determining the fair value of reporting units for fiscal 2024, our key judgements related to reporting unit revenue growth rates and the 

weighted-average cost

of capital applicable

to peer and

industry comparables

of the reporting

units. In

determining the

fair value of 

reporting units

for fiscal

2023, we

considered entity-specific

growth rates,

future expected

cash flows

to be

used in

our discounted 

cash flow model, and the weighted-average cost of capital applicable to

peer and industry comparables of the reporting units. We base 

our estimates

on assumptions

we believe

to be

reasonable but

that are

unpredictable and

inherently uncertain.

In addition,

we make 

judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting

units. 

The results of our impairment tests during fiscal 2024

indicated that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded

their carrying 

values and

so did

not require

impairment. The

results of

our impairment

tests during

fiscal 2023

indicated that

the fair value

of our 

reporting

units

exceeded

their carrying

values,

with

the

exception

of

the $7.0

million

of goodwill

impaired

during

fiscal 202

3,

as 

discussed in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 

Intangible Assets Acquired Through Acquisitions

The

fair values

of the

identifiable

intangible

assets acquired

through

acquisitions

were determined

by management

using

the 

purchase method

of accounting.

We

did not

identify any

significant intangible

assets related

to the

Touchsides

acquisition in

fiscal 

2024\. We completed the acquisition

of Connect during fiscal 2022 where we identified and recognized intangible assets. We

used the 

relief from royalty method to value identified brands

and the multi-period excess earnings method to value

the integrated platform and 

identified customer relationships. We

have used the relief from royalty method,

the multi-period excess earnings method, the income 

approach

and

the

cost

approach

to

value

other

historic

acquisition-related

intangible

assets.

In

so

doing,

we

made

assumptions 

regarding

expected

future revenues

and

expenses

to develop

the underlying

forecasts, applied

contributory

asset charges,

discount 

rates, exchange rates, cash tax charges and useful lives.

The valuations were based on information available at the

time of the acquisition and the expectations and

assumptions that were 

deemed reasonable by us. No assurance can be given, however,

that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets 

will occur as

projected. For these

reasons, among others,

the actual cash

flows may vary

from forecasts of

future cash flows.

To

the 

extent actual cash flows vary, revisions to the useful life or impairment of intangible assets may be necessary.

Management assess the 

useful life of

the acquired intangible

assets upon initial

recognition and revisions

to the useful

life or impairment

of these intangible 

assets may be necessary in the future. 

Revenue recognition – principal versus agent considerations

We generate

revenue from the provision of transaction-processing

services through our various platforms

and service offerings. 

We

use these

platforms to

(a) sell

prepaid airtime

vouchers which

was held

as inventory

and (b)

distribute VAS,

including prepaid 

airtime vouchers (which

we do

not hold as

inventory), prepaid electricity, gaming voucher,

and other services,

to users

of our platforms. 

The

determination

of whether

we

act as

a principal

or as

an agent

when providing

these services

requires

a significant

amount

of 

judgement and is based on whether (i)

we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise

to provide the specified goods or service, 

(ii) we

have

inventory

risk before

the specified

good or

service has

been

transferred

to a

customer

and

(iii) we

have

discretion

in 

establishing the

price for

the specified

good or

service. When

we are

the principal

in a

transaction, such

as when

we purchase

(and 

thus control and assume

inventory risk) prepaid airtime

before selling it to customers

utilizing our platform,

revenue is reported on

a 

gross basis. When

we are an

agent in a

transaction, such

as when we

distribute VAS

on behalf of

our customers,

and do not

control 

the

good

or

service

to

be

provided,

revenue

is

recognized

based

on

the

amount

that

we

are

contractually

entitled

to

receive

for 

performing the distribution service on behalf of our customers using our

platform.


Valuation

of investment in Cell C 

We have elected to measure

our investment in

Cell C, an

unlisted equity security, at fair

value using the

fair value option.

Changes 

in

the

fair

value

of

this

equity

security

are

recognized

in

the

caption

“change

in

fair

value

of

equity

securities”

in

our

audited 

consolidated statements of operations. The tax impact related to the change in

fair value of equity securities is included in income tax 

expense in our audited

consolidated statements of operation.

The determination of

the fair value of this

equity security requires us

to 

make significant judgments

and estimates.

We base our estimates

on assumptions we

believe to be

reasonable but that

are unpredictable 

and inherently uncertain. Refer

to Note 6

of our audited consolidated

financial statements regarding the

valuation inputs and

sensitivity 

related to our investment in Cell C. 

We used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our investment in Cell C as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and 

valued Cell C at

$0.0

(zero) as of each of

June 30, 2024 and 2023.

We utilized the latest business plan provided by Cell

C management 

for the period ended December 31,

2027, for the June 30, 2024

and 2023 valuations, and the

following key valuation inputs were used: 

Weighted Average

Cost of Capital: 

Between 21% and 26% over the period of the forecast 

Long-term growth rate: 

4.5% (4.5% as of June 30, 2023) 

Marketability discount: 

21% (20% as of June 30, 2023) 

Minority discount: 

24% (24% as of June 30, 2023) 

Net adjusted external debt - June 30, 2024:

ZAR 8 billion ($0.4 billion), no lease liabilities included 

Net adjusted external debt - June 30, 2023:

ZAR 8.1 billion ($0.4 billion), no lease liabilities included 

translated from ZAR to U.S. dollars at exchange rates applicable

as of June 30, 2024. 

translated from ZAR to U.S. dollars at exchange rates applicable

as of June 30, 2023.

We

believe the

Cell C

business plan

is reasonable

based on

the current

performance and

the expected

changes in

the business 

model. Refer to the sensitivity analysis included in

Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements

related to our valuation of 

Cell C as of June 30, 2024. 

Recoverability of equity securities and equity-accounted investments 

We

review our

equity securities

and equity-accounted

investments for

impairment whenever

events or

circumstances indicate 

that the

carrying amount

of the

investment may

not be

recoverable.

In performing

this review,

we are

required to

estimate the

fair 

value of our

equity-accounted investments and other

equity securities. The

determination of the

fair value of

these investments requires 

us to make significant judgments and estimates.

Other equity securities include our investments in MobiKwik and CPS. These equity securities do not have readily determinable 

fair

values

and

therefore

we

have

elected

to

measure

these

investments

at

cost

minus

impairment,

if

any,

plus

or

minus

changes 

resulting

from

observable

price

changes

in

orderly

transactions

for

the

identical

or

a

similar

investment

of

the

same

issuer.

If

we 

identify an impairment indicator related

to these equity

securities, we are required

to assess the

carrying value of these

equity securities 

against their fair

value. We

did not identify

any impairment indicators

during each

of fiscal 2024,


and 2022,

and therefore did 

not recognize any impairment losses related to these equity securities during

those years. 

The determination of the fair value of an investment requires us to make significant judgments and estimates. We are required to 

base our

estimates on

assumptions

which we

believe to

be reasonable,

but these

assumptions may

be unpredictable

and inherently 

uncertain. 

The Company did

not identify any

observable transactions

during either of

the years ended June

30, 2024, 2023

and 2022, and 

therefore there was no change in

the fair value of MobiKwik

during the year. During the year ended June 30,

2021, MobiKwik entered 

into

a

number

of

separate

agreements

with

new

shareholders

to

raise

additional

capital

through

the

issuance

of

additional

shares. 

Specifically,

our

current

valuation

is based

on

an

observable

price

change

in

an orderly

transaction

for

similar

or

identical equity 

securities issued by MobiKwik

in a capital raise concluded

in June 2021, of $245.50

per share. The carrying value

of our investment 

in MobiKwik is

$76.3 million as

of June 30,

2024\. Any change

in the fair

value of MobiKwik

is included in

the caption “Change

in 

fair value of equity securities” in our audited consolidated statement of operations

. 

We did

not identify any impairment indicators

during fiscal 2022 and therefore

did not recognize any impairment

losses related 

to our

equity-accounted investments

during that

year.

We

performed impairment

assessments

during fiscal

2024 and

2023, for

our 

investment in

Finbond Group

Limited “(Finbond”)

following the

identification of

certain impairment

indicators. The

results of

our 

impairment tests

during fiscal


and 2023,

resulted in

impairments of

$1.2 million

and $1.1

million, respectively,

related to

our 

equity-accounted investments. These impairments are discussed in Note

9 to our audited consolidated financial

statements. On August 

10, 2023, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary

Net1 Finance Holdings (Pty) Ltd, entered into an agreement

with Finbond to sell 

our remaining shareholding to Finbond for a cash consideration of ZAR 64.2

million ($3.5 million), or ZAR 0.2911 per share.


For

fiscal

2024,

in

determining

the

fair

value

of

Finbond,

we

used

the

price

of

ZAR

0.2911

referenced

in

the

August


agreement to calculate

the determined fair value

for Finbond. For

fiscal 2023, in determining

the fair value of

Finbond, as it is

listed 

on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, its market price as

of the impairment assessment dates, adjusted for a

liquidity discount of 25%. 

We based our estimates on assumptions

we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. The fair 

value of

our investment

in Finbond

was sensitive

to movements

in its

market price,

which is

quoted in

ZAR, because

we used

the 

market price as the basis of our valuation. 

Deferred Taxation 

We

estimate

our

tax

liability

through

the

calculations

done

for

the

determination

of

our

current

tax

liability,

together

with 

assessing temporary

differences

resulting

from the

different

treatment of

items for

tax and

accounting purposes.

These differ

ences 

result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are disclosed on our balance

sheet.

Management then

has to assess

the likelihood

that deferred tax

assets are more

likely than not

to be realized

in the foreseeable 

future. A valuation allowance is

created if it is determined

that a deferred tax asset will not

be realized in the foreseeable

future. Any 

change to the valuation allowance

would be charged or

credited to income in the period

such determination is made. In

assessing the 

need for a valuation allowance,

historical levels of income, expectations

and risks associated with estimates of

future taxable income 

and

ongoing

prudent

and

practicable

tax

planning

strategies

are

considered.

During

fiscal

2024,

2023,

and

2022,

respectively

we 

recorded a net decrease of $5.6 million,

$8.0 million and $1.7 million, to our

valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2024

and 2023, the 

valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets was $114.7

million and $109.1 million, respectively. 

Stock-based Compensation

Management is required to make estimates and assumptions related to our valuation and recording of stock-based

compensation 

charges under

current accounting

standards. These standards

require all share-based

compensation to employees

to be recognized

in 

the

statement

of

operations

based on

their

respective

grant date

fair

values

over

the requisite

service

periods

and

also

requires

an 

estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense.

We utilize the Cox Ross

Rubinstein binomial model to

measure the fair

value of stock

options granted to

employees and directors. 

We

have also utilized

a bespoke adjusted Monte

Carlo simulation discounted

cash flow model to

measure the fair value

of restricted 

stock with market

conditions granted to

employees and directors.

The stock-based compensation

cost related to

these valuations has 

been

recognized

on

a

straight-line

basis.

These

valuation

models

require

estimates

of

a

number

of

key

valuation

inputs

including 

expected volatility, expected dividend yield, expected term and

risk-free interest rate. Our

management has estimated forfeitures based 

on

historic

employee

behavior

under

similar

compensation

plans.

The

fair

value

of

stock

options

is

affected

by

the

assumptions 

selected. The fair value calculation is especially sensitive

to our valuation assumption with respect to expected volatility. For instance, 

a 5% increase (to 53%) or 5% decrease (to 43%) in the expected volatility used (of 48%) to value stock options granted in June 2024, 

would result

in a

charge that

was 11%

higher (if

53% were

used) or

11%

lower (if

43% were

used). Net

stock-based compensation 

expense from continuing operations was $7.9 million, $7.3 million and $3.0

million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses

We 

use a lifetime loss rate by expressing

write-off experience as a percentage

of corresponding invoice amounts (as

opposed to 

outstanding balances). The allowance for credit losses related to these receivables has been calculated by multiplying the lifetime loss 

rate with recent invoice/origination amounts.

Prior to July 1, 2023, a specific provision is established where it is considered likely that all or a portion of the amount due from 

customers

renting

safe

assets,

point

of

sale

(“POS”)

equipment,

receiving

support

and

maintenance

or

transaction

services

or 

purchasing licenses

or SIM

cards from

us that

will not

be recovered.

Non-recoverability is

assessed based

on a

quarterly review

by 

management of the

ageing of outstanding

amounts, the location and

the payment history of

the customer in relation

to those specific 

amounts. 

We use historical default experience over the lifetime of loans in order to calculate a lifetime loss

rate for our lending books. The 

allowance for

credit losses related

to Consumer

finance loans receivables

is calculated by

multiplying the

lifetime loss rate

with the 

month-end outstanding lending book.

Prior to July

1, 2023, we

regularly reviewed the

ageing of outstanding

amounts due from

borrowers and adjusted

its allowance 

based

on

management’s

estimate

of

the

recoverability

of

the

finance

loans

receivable.

We

write

off

microlending

finance

loans 

receivable and related service fees and

interest if a borrower is in arrears

with repayments for more than three months

or is deceased. 

We write off merchant and working capital finance

receivables and related fees when

it is evident that

reasonable recovery procedures, 

including where deemed necessary,

formal legal action, have failed.


Lending 

Merchant lending

The allowance for credit losses related to Merchant finance loans receivables

is calculated by adding together actual receivables 

in

default

plus

multiplying

the

lifetime

loss

rate

with

the

month-end

outstanding

lending

book.

Our

risk

management

procedures 

include adhering to

our proprietary lending

criteria which

uses an

online-system loan application

process, obtaining necessary

customer 

transaction-history

data

and

credit

bureau

checks.

We

consider

these

procedures

to

be

appropriate

because

it

takes

into

account

a 

variety of factors such as the customer’s credit capacity and

customer-specific risk factors when originating a loan. 

We 

recently (in the past

three years) commenced lending

to merchant customers and

uses historical default experience

over the 

lifetime of loans generated thus

far in order to calculate

a lifetime loss

rate for the lending book.

The allowance for credit losses

related 

to these merchant finance loans receivables is calculated by adding together actual receivables in default plus multiplying the lifetime 

loss

rate

with

the

month-end

outstanding

lending

book.

The

lifetime

loss

rate

as

of

each of

July

1,


and

June

30,

2024,

was 

approximately 1.18%.

The performing

component (that

is, outstanding

loan payments

not in

arrears), under-performing

component 

(that is, outstanding loan payments that are in arrears)

and non-performing component (that is, outstanding loans

for which payments 

appeared to have ceased) of the book represents approximately 84%, 15% and 1%, respectively, of the outstanding lending book as of 

June 30, 2024. 

Prior to

July 1, 2023,

we maintained

an allowance

for credit

losses -

finance loans

receivable related

to our Merchant

services 

segment

with

respect

to

short-term

loans

to

qualifying

merchant

customers.

Our

policy

was

to

regularly

review

the

ageing

of 

outstanding

amounts due

from these

merchants and

an allowance

is created

for the

full amount

outstanding if

the customer

was in 

arrears for more than 15 days. We wrote off loans and related interest and fees when it is evident that reasonable recovery procedures, 

including where deemed necessary,

formal legal action, had failed. 

Consumer microlending 

The allowance for credit

losses related to Consumer finance

loans receivables is calculated

by multiplying the lifetime

loss rate 

with

the

month-end

outstanding

lending

book.

Loans

to

customers

have

a

tenor

of

up

to

six

months,

with

the

majority

of

loans 

originated having a

tenor of six months.

Credit bureau checks

as well as an

affordability test are

conducted as part

of the origination 

process, both

of which

are in

line with

local regulations.

We

consider this

policy to

be appropriate

because the

affordability

test it 

performs takes into account a variety of factors such

as other debts and total expenditures on normal

household and lifestyle expenses. 

Additional allowances

may be

required should

the ability

of its

customers to

make payments

when due

deteriorate in

the future.

A 

significant amount

of judgment is

required to

assess the ultimate

recoverability of

these finance loan

receivables, including

ongoing 

evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer. 

We 

have operated this

lending book for

more than five

years and use

historical default experience

over the lifetime

of loans in 

order to calculate a lifetime loss rate for the lending book. 

We 

analyze this lending book as a single portfolio because the loans within 

the portfolio

have similar characteristics

and management

uses similar processes

to monitor

and assess the

credit risk of

the lending 

book. The allowance for credit losses related to these microlending finance loans receivables is calculated

by multiplying the lifetime 

loss rate with the month end outstanding lending book. The

lifetime loss rate as of each

of July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024,

was 6.50%. 

The performing

component

(that is,

outstanding

loan payments

not in

arrears)

of the

book exceeds

more than

98% of

outstanding 

lending book as of June 30, 2024. 

Prior to July

1, 2023, we

maintained an allowance

for credit losses

\- finance loans

receivable related to

our Consumer services 

segment with respect

to short-term loans

to qualifying customers.

Our policy was

to regularly review

the ageing

of outstanding amounts 

due from

borrowers and

adjust the

provision based

on management’s

estimate of

the recoverability

of finance

loans receivable.

We 

wrote off microlending loans and related service fees if

a borrower is in arrears with repayments for more than three months or dies.

Translation Exchange Rates

We are required

to translate our results of operations from ZAR to U.S. dollars on a monthly

basis. Thus, the average rates used 

to translate this data for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, vary slightly from the averages shown in the table above. The 

translation rates we use in presenting our results of operations are the rates shown

in the following table:

We have translated the results of operations and operating segment information for the year

ended June 30, 2024, provided in the 

tables below

using the

actual average

exchange rates

per month

between the

USD and

ZAR in order

to reduce

the reconciliation

of 

information presented to our chief operating

decision maker. The impact of

using this method compared with the average rate

for the 

quarter and year to date is not significant, however, it does result in minor differences.

We believe that presentation using

the average 

exchange

rates

per

month

compared

with

the

average

exchange

rate

per

quarter

and

for

the

year

improves

the

accuracy

of

the 

information presented in our

external financial reporting and

leads to fewer

differences between our external reporting

measures which 

are supplementally presented in ZAR, and our internal management

information, which is also presented in ZAR.


Results of operations

The

discussion

of our

consolidated overall

results of

operations is

based on

amounts

as reflected

in our

audited consolidated 

financial statements which are prepared in accordance

with U.S. GAAP.

We analyze our

results of operations both in U.S. dollars, as 

presented in the audited consolidated financial statements, and supplementally in ZAR, because ZAR is the functional currency of the 

entities which contribute the majority of our results and is the currency in which

the majority of our transactions are initially incurred 

and

measured.

Presentation

of

our

reported

results

in

ZAR

is

a

non-GAAP

measure.

Due

to

the

significant

impact

of

currency 

fluctuations between

the U.S. dollar

and ZAR on

our reported

results and

because we

use the

U.S. dollar as

our reporting

currency, 

we believe that

the supplemental presentation

of our results

of operations in

ZAR is useful

to investors to

understand the changes

in 

the underlying trends of our business.

Our

operating

segment

revenue

presented

in

“—Results

of

operations

by

operating

segment”

represents

total

revenue

per 

operating segment before intercompany

eliminations. A reconciliation between

total operating segment revenue and

revenue, as well 

as the reconciliation between our segment performance measure and net loss before tax (benefits) expense, is presented in our audited 

consolidated financial statements in Note

21 to those statements. Our chief operating

decision maker was our Group Chief

Executive 

Officer until

February 29, 2024

and has been

our Executive Chairman

since March 1,

2024, and our

Group Chief Executive

Officer 

evaluated and our

Executive Chairman evaluates,

respectively,

segment performance based

on segment earnings

before interest, tax, 

depreciation

and amortization

(“EBITDA”),

adjusted for

items mentioned

in the

next sentence

(“Segment Adjusted

EBITDA”) for 

each operating

segment. We

do not allocate

once-off items

(as defined below),

stock-based compensation

charges, depreciation

and 

amortization,

impairment

of goodwill

or other

intangible assets,

certain

lease

expenses

(“Lease expenses”),

other

items

(including 

gains or

losses on

disposal of

investments,

fair value

adjustments to

equity

securities, fair

value

adjustments

to currency

options), 

interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or loss

from equity-accounted investments to our reportable segments. Once-off 

items represents non-recurring expense

items, including costs related to

acquisitions and transactions consummated

or ultimately not 

pursued. The Lease

expenses reflect lease

expenses (refer to

Note 8 to

our audited consolidated

financial statements)

and the Stock-

based compensation

adjustments reflect

stock-based compensation

expense and

are both

excluded from

the calculation

of Segment 

Adjusted EBITDA and

are therefore reported

as reconciling items to

reconcile the reportable

segments’ Segment Adjusted

EBITDA 

to our loss before income tax expense. 

Group Adjusted

EBITDA represents

Segment

Adjusted EBITDA

after deducting

Lease expenses

and group

costs. Refer

also 

“Results of Operations—Use of Non-GAAP Measures” below. 

Fiscal 2024

and 2023 includes

Connect for

the entire fiscal

year and

fiscal 2022

includes consolidation

of Connect

from April 

14, 2022. Refer also to Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements for

additional information regarding this transaction. 

We analyze our business and operations in terms of two

inter-related but independent operating segments: Merchant Division 

and 

Consumer Division.

In addition,

corporate activities

that are

impracticable to

allocate directly

to the

operating segments,

as 

well as any inter-segment eliminations, are included in Group costs. Inter-segment revenue eliminations are included

in Eliminations.

Fiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023

The following factors had

a significant influence on

our results of

operations during fiscal 2024

as compared with

the same period 

in the prior year: 

●

Higher revenue: 

Our revenues increased by 11.4% in ZAR, primarily due to an increase in low margin prepaid airtime sales 

and other value-added

services, as well as

higher transaction, insurance

and lending revenues, which

was partially offset

by 

lower hardware sales revenue in our POS hardware distribution business given

the lumpy nature of bulk sales;

●

Operating

income

generated: 

Operating

profitability

was

achieved

following

years

of

operating

losses

as

a

result

of the 

various cost reduction initiatives in Consumer implemented in prior periods as well as the contribution

from Connect; 

●

Higher net interest charge:

The net interest

charge increased to

ZAR 311.2

million from ZAR 299.9

million primarily due 

to higher interest rates; 

●

Significant transaction costs:

We expensed $2.3 million of transaction costs related to the Adumo transaction in fiscal 2024; 

and 

●

Foreign exchange movements:

The U.S. dollar was 4.1% stronger against the ZAR during fiscal

2024 compared to the prior 

period, which adversely impacted our U.S. dollar reported results. 


Consolidated overall results of operations 

This discussion is based on the amounts prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Revenue increased by $36.3 million (ZAR 1.1 billion), or 6.9% (in ZAR, 11.4%),

primarily due to the increase in the number of 

low-margin

prepaid

airtime

vouchers

sold

and

an

increase

in

volume

of

other

value-added

services

provided,

as

well

as

higher 

transaction volumes processed, insurance premiums collected

and lending revenues following an increase in loan

originations, which 

was partially offset

by a lower

number of

hardware sales in

our POS hardware

distribution business

given the

lumpy nature of

bulk 

sales. Refer to discussion above at “—Recent Developments”

for a description of key trends impacting our revenue this fiscal year. 


Cost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and

support increased by $25.1 million (ZAR

0.8 billion), or 6.0% (in ZAR,

10.5%), 

primarily due to

the increase in low

margin prepaid airtime

sales, which were

partially offset by

the lower cost of

goods sold related 

to fewer hardware sales. 

Selling, general and

administration expenses decreased

by $3.0 million

(in USD 3.2%),

and increased by

ZAR 15.4 million

(in 

ZAR, 0.9%)

.

In ZAR,

the modest

increase

was primarily

due to

higher employee

-related expenses

related

to the

expansion of

our 

senior management team and the year-over-year

impact of inflationary increases on employee-related

expenses, which were partially 

offset by the benefits of various cost reduction initiatives in Consumer

. 

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.02

million (in USD, 0.1%),

and increased by ZAR 17.7 million

(in ZAR, 

4.2%).

In ZAR, the increase was due to an increase in depreciation expense related to additional POS devices

deployed. 

During fiscal 2023, we

recorded an impairment loss

of $7.0 million related

to the impairment of

our hardware/ software supply 

business

unit’s

allocated

goodwill.

Refer

to

Note


of

our

audited

consolidated

financial

statements

for

additional

information 

regarding these impairment losses. 

Transaction costs related to Adumo

acquisition includes fees

paid to external

service providers associated

with legal, commercial, 

financial and tax due

diligence activities performed,

fees paid to legal advisors

to draft the purchase

agreement as well as

other legal 

and advisory services procured related to the transaction. 

Our operating income

(loss) margin in

fiscal 2024 and 2023

was 0.6% and (2.9%),

respectively.

We

discuss the components of 

operating loss margin under “—Results of operations

by operating segment.”

We

did

not

record

any

changes

in

the

fair

value

of

equity

interests

in

MobiKwik

and

Cell

C

during

fiscal


and

2023, 

respectively.

We continue

to carry our investment

in Cell C at $0

(zero). Refer to Note

9 to our consolidated financial

statements for 

the methodology

and inputs used

in the fair

value calculation for

MobiKwik and Note

6 for the

methodology and

inputs used in

the 

fair value calculation for Cell C. 

During fiscal 2024, we

received an outstanding amount

of $0.3 million related

to the sale

of Carbon in fiscal

2023, which resulted 

in the reversal

of an allowance

for doubtful

loans receivable

of $0.3

million recorded

in fiscal 2023.

We

recorded a

net loss of

$0.2 

million comprising a

loss of $0.4 million

related to the disposal of

a minor portion of

our investment in Finbond

and a $0.25 million 

gain related to the disposal of our entire interest in Carbon during fiscal 2023. Refer

to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

for additional information regarding these disposals. 

Interest on

surplus cash

increased to

$2.3 million

(ZAR 42.9

million) from

$1.9 million

(ZAR 33.2

million), primarily

due to 

higher interest rates. 

Interest expense increased

to $18.9 million

(ZAR 354.0 million)

from $18.6 million

(ZAR 333.1 million),

primarily as a

result 

of higher overall

interest rates and

higher overall borrowings

during fiscal 2024

compared with comparable

period in the

prior year, 

which was partially offset by lower interest

expense incurred on certain of our borrowings

for which we were able to negotiate lower 

rates of interest during the latter half of fiscal 2023 and again towards the end

of calendar 2023. 

Fiscal 2024 tax

expense was $3.4

million (ZAR 62.6

million) compared to

a tax benefit

of $(2.3) million

(ZAR (41.4) million) 

in

fiscal

2023.

Our

effective

tax

rate

for

fiscal


was

impacted

by

the

tax

expense

recorded

by

our

profitable

South

African 

operations, a

deferred tax

benefit related

to acquisition-related

intangible asset

amortization, non-deductible

expenses, the

on-going 

losses incurred by certain

of our South African businesses and

the associated valuation allowances created

related to the deferred tax 

assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities. 

Our effective

tax rate for

fiscal 2024 was impacted

by a reduction

in the enacted

South African corporate

income tax rate from 

28% to 27% from January 2023 (but backdated to July 1, 2022), the tax expense recorded by our profitable South African operations, 

a

deferred

tax

benefit

related

to

acquisition-related

intangible

asset

amortization,

non-deductible

expenses,

a

deferred

tax

benefit 

related to an expense paid by Connect before

we acquired the business and which subsequently has been

determined to be deductible 

for

tax purposes,

the on-going

losses incurred

by certain

of our

South

African

businesses and

the associated

valuation

allowances 

created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating

losses incurred by these entities.


Finbond is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange

and reports its six-month results during

our first half and its

annual results 

during our fourth quarter.

We sold

our entire remaining interest in

Finbond during the second

quarter of fiscal 2024. 

We 

recorded an 

impairment loss related to our

investment in Finbond in fiscal

2024 as the carrying value

of Finbond exceeded the fair

value of holding 

in Finbond

using the

price of

ZAR 0.2911

per share

referenced in

the August

2023 agreement

with Finbond.

We

also recorded

an 

impairment loss in fiscal 202


following on-going losses reported

by Finbond and its lower

listed share price.

Refer to Note 9 to

our 

consolidated financial statements for additional information

regarding the impairments.

Group Adjusted EBITDA

is a non-GAAP measure, refer

to reconciliation below at

“—Results of Operations—Use of

Non-

Merchant 

Segment revenue increased due to the increase in prepaid airtime vouchers

sold and other value-added services provided, which 

was partially offset

by a lower

number of

hardware sales in

our POS hardware

distribution business

given the

lumpy nature of

bulk 

sales as

well as

lower revenue

generated

from a

decrease

in certain

valued-added

services transaction

volumes processed

(such

as 

international money transfers). In ZAR, the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA

is primarily due to the higher sales activity, which 

was partially offset by lower hardware sales

Prepaid airtime sales 

In South Africa and other countries, mobile network operators (“MNOs”) offer prepaid or contract (or postpaid) services to their 

customers to telephony

services using a

mobile telephony network

or networks. MNOs

also offer similar

products (prepaid or

postpaid) 

for mobile data

which uses other

wireless network protocols

such as wireless

fidelity (“wifi”).

We

use the term

“prepaid airtime”

to 

include both of these prepaid products.

Generally speaking, the difference between the two

models is that prepaid is

paid for upfront by the

customer and contract is paid 

in arrears. MNOs sell prepaid products directly to their customers and also indirectly

to their customers through distribution channels 

(which include wholesalers, retailers and other parties, including ourselves). 

We sell

a variety of products through our

distribution channels, including prepaid airtime,

prepaid electricity,

gaming vouchers. 

We refer to these

products collectively as VAS. 

In order to “load” airtime onto

a mobile device an MNOs customer

requires a prepaid airtime voucher. A unique code is

assigned 

to each prepaid

airtime voucher and

is required to

activate the prepaid

airtime on a

mobile device. Like

certain tangible goods,

once 

sold, our

customers cannot

return prepaid

airtime vouchers

to us (except

of course

if there is

a defect

in the

service provided

by us, 

which rarely occurs). 

We

can either

purchase an

agreed quantity

of prepaid

airtime vouchers

upfront directly

from

wholesalers or

other parties

(so 

called “Pinned airtime” - these electronic vouchers are stored

on a server owned and maintained by us and we treat

these vouchers as 

inventory)

or

we

can

“interface”

directly

into

a

wholesaler

and

deliver

the

airtime

voucher

directly

to

our

customers

(typically 

merchants) as the airtime is sold by the merchant to MNOs customers (so called Pinless airtime).


Our Segment

Adjusted EBITDA

(loss) margin

(calculated as

Segment Adjusted

EBITDA (loss)

divided by

revenue) in

fiscal 

2024 and 2023 was 6.7% and 7.2%, respectively. 

Consumer

Segment revenue increased

primarily due to

more transaction fees

generated from the

higher EPE account

holders base, higher 

insurance revenues, and an increase

in lending revenue as

a result of an

increase in loan originations.

This increase in revenue,

together 

with the cost reduction

initiatives initiated in fiscal

2022 and through

fiscal 2023, have

translated into a turnaround

in the Consumer 

Division and

the realization

of sustained

positive Segment

Adjusted EBITDA

in fiscal

2024 compared

with fiscal

2023\. Consumer 

Segment Adjusted

EBITDA during

fiscal 2024

was also

impacted by

higher credit

losses (as

a result

of an increase

in originations) 

and higher insurance-related claims (as a result of a higher number of

insurance policies) compared with fiscal 2023. 

Our Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin in fiscal 2024

and 2023

was 21.2% and 5.3%, respectively. 

Group costs 

Our group

costs primarily

include employee

related costs

in relation

to employees

specifically hired

for group

roles and

costs 

related

directly

to

managing

the

US-listed

entity;

expenditures

related

to

compliance

with

the

Sarbanes-Oxley

Act

of

2002;

non-

employee directors’ fees; legal fees; group and US-listed related audit

fees; and directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums. 

Our group costs for

fiscal 2024 decreased compared

with the prior period

due to lower external

audit, legal and consulting

fees 

and lower provision for executive bonuses, which was partially offset

by higher employee costs and travel expenses. 

Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022

The following factors had

a significant influence on

our results of

operations during fiscal

2023 as compared with

the same period 

in the prior year: 

●

Higher revenue: 

Our revenues

increased by

180.0% in

ZAR, primarily

due to

the contribution

from Connect

in Merchant 

and an increase in account fees and insurance revenues in Consumer;

●

Lower operating

losses: 

Operating

losses decreased,

delivering

an improvement

of 55%

in ZAR

compared

with the

prior 

period

primarily

due

to

the

contribution

from

Connect,

strong

hardware

sales,

and

the

implementation

of

various

cost 

reduction

initiatives

in

Consumer,

which

was

partially

offset

by

an

increase

in

acquisition

related

intangible

asset 

amortization; 

●

Higher

net

interest

charge:

The

net

interest

charge

increased

to

ZAR

299.9

million

from

ZAR

56.9

million

due

to

the 

additional borrowings

incurred in

order to

fund the

acquisition of

Connect as

well as

the debt

acquired within

the Connect 

business itself; 

●

Significant transaction costs:

We expensed $6.0 million of transaction

costs related to

the Connect acquisition in

fiscal 2022; 

and 

●

Foreign exchange movements:

The U.S. dollar was 18.0% stronger against the ZAR

during fiscal 2023, which impacted our 

reported results.

Revenue increased by $305.4 million (ZAR 6.1 billion), or 137.2% (in ZAR, 180.0%), primarily due to the inclusion of Connect 

for

the entire

fiscal year,

which has

substantial low

margin

prepaid

airtime sales

in addition

to its

core processing

revenue and

an 

increase in account fees and insurance revenues.


Cost of

goods sold,

IT processing,

servicing and

support increased

by $249.2

million (ZAR

4.9 billion),

or 148.1%

(in ZAR, 

192.8%), primarily due to the inclusion of Connect,

which were partially offset by the benefits of

various cost reduction initiatives in 

Consumer and lower insurance-related claims. 

Selling, general and administration expenses increased by $20.1 million (ZAR 0.6 billion), or 26.7% (in ZAR, 49.6%), primarily 

due

to

higher

employee-related

expenses

related

to

the

expansion

of

our

senior

management

team,

the

year-over-year

impact

of 

inflationary

increases

on

employee-related

expenses

and

the

inclusion

of

expenses

related

to

Connect’s

operations,

which

were 

partially offset by the benefits of various cost reduction initiatives in Consumer. 

Depreciation and

amortization expense

increased by

$16.1 million

(ZAR 309.8

million), or

212.7% (in

ZAR, 269.1%),

due to 

the

inclusion

of

acquisition-related

intangible

asset

amortization

related

to

intangible

assets

identified

pursuant

to

the

Connect 

acquisition, as well as the inclusion of depreciation expense related to

Connect’s property,

plant and equipment. 

During fiscal 2023, we

recorded an impairment loss

of $7.0 million related

to the impairment of

our hardware/ software supply 

business

unit’s

allocated

goodwill.

Refer

to

Note


of

our

audited

consolidated

financial

statements

for

additional

information 

regarding these impairment losses. 

We embarked on a retrenchment process on January 10, 2022, and incurred reorganization expenses of $5.9 million during fiscal 

2022\. 

Transaction

costs related

to Connect

acquisition in

fiscal 2022

includes fees

paid to

external service

providers associated

with 

the contract drafting and negotiations; corporate finance advisory services; legal, financial and tax due diligence

activities performed; 

warranty and

indemnity insurance

related to the

transaction; and other

advisory services procured;

as well as

our portion

of the fees 

paid to competition authorities related to the regulatory filings made in

various jurisdictions. 

Our operating loss

margin in fiscal


and 2022

was

(2.9%) and

(18.1%), respectively. 

We 

discuss the

components of operating 

loss margin under “—Results of operations by operating

any

changes

in

the

fair

respectively.

We continue

these disposals. 

We recorded

a gain of $0.7 million related to the disposal of our entire interest

in an equity security during fiscal 2022. Refer to 

Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

regarding this gain. 

Interest on surplus cash decreased to $1.9 million (ZAR

33.2 million) from $2.1 million (ZAR 31.7 million), primarily

due to the 

inclusion of Connect, which was partially offset by lower overall surplus

cash balances following the acquisition of Connect. 

Interest expense increased

to $18.6 million

(ZAR 333.1 million)

from $5.8 million

(ZAR 88.6 million),

primarily as a result

of 

additional

interest

expense

incurred

related

to

borrowings

obtained

to

partially

fund

the acquisition

of

Connect,

interest

expenses 

incurred in Connect to fund our cash management, digitization and VAS offerings, and a higher utilization of our facilities to fund our 

ATMs,

which was also coupled with an increase in base interest rates. 

Fiscal 2023

tax benefit was $(2.3) million (ZAR (41.4) million) compared

to a tax expense of $0.3 million (ZAR 5.0 million) in 

fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was impacted by a reduction in

Consumer Segment Adjustment EBITDA for fiscal 2022 includes

reorganization cost of ZAR 89.6 million. 

Lease expenses

which were previously

excluded from the

calculation of Group

Adjusted EBITDA have

now been included 

in the calculation. This change is

in response to comments received from

the staff of the SEC in

March 2024 regarding our non-GAAP 

financial reporting. Comparative information has been adjusted to conform

with the updated presentation. 

Group Adjusted EBITDA

is a non-GAAP measure, refer

to reconciliation below at

“—Results of Operations—Use of

Non-

GAAP Measures”. 

Merchant 

Segment

revenue

increased

due

to

the

contribution

from

Connect

for

the

full fiscal

year

compared

with

only

two

and a

half 

months in fiscal

2022\. This increase

was partially offset

by lower hardware

sales revenue given

the lumpy nature

of bulk sales.

The 

increase in

Segment Adjusted

EBITDA is

also due

to the inclusion

of Connect,

which was partially

offset by

lower hardware

sales. 

Connect records a significant proportion of its airtime sales in revenue and cost of sales, while only earning a relatively small margin. 

This significantly depresses the Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins

shown by the business. 

Our Segment

Adjusted EBITDA

(loss) margin

(calculated as

Segment Adjusted

EBITDA (loss)

divided by

revenue) in

fiscal 


and 2022 was 7.2% and 8.1%, respectively. 

Consumer

Segment revenue increased primarily due to higher insurance revenues and higher account holder fees, though this was partially 

offset by

lower ATM

transaction fees.

We

embarked on a

retrenchment process

during the third

quarter of fiscal

2022 and recorded 

an expense of

$5.9 million which is

included in Segment

Adjusted EBITDA loss. The

cost reduction initiatives

we initiated in

fiscal 

2022 delivered

a significant

reduction in

Consumer’s operating

expenses which

resulted in

a significantly

lower Segment

Adjusted 

EBITDA

loss

compared

with

fiscal

2022.

Specifically,

expenses

associated

with

operating

a

mobile

distribution

network

were 

discontinued

in

early

fiscal

2022,

and

we

have

streamlined

our

fixed

distribution

network

through

reductions

in

certain

expenses 

including

employee-related

costs,

security,

guarding

and

premises costs.

In

June


we

recalibrated

our

allowance

for

doubtful 

microlending finance

loans receivable

from 10%

of the

lending book

outstanding to

6.5% of

the lending

book, which

resulted in

a 

release from the allowance in fiscal 2022. 

Our Segment

Adjusted EBITDA loss

margin in

fiscal 2023

and 2022

was 5.3% and

(32.9%), respectively.

After adjusting for 

the

reorganization

charge

our fiscal


Segment

Adjusted

EBITDA

loss margin

was

(23.9%).

Segment

Adjusted

EBITDA

loss 

margin before the reorganization charge is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that the presentation of our Segment Adjusted EBITDA 

loss margin

before the

reorganization

charge

is useful

to investors

to understand

the improvement

in the

operating performance

in 

Consumer, before the reorganization

charge, in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022.

Group costs 

Our

group

costs

for

fiscal


increased

compared

with

the

prior

period

due

to

higher

employee

costs

and

an

increase

in 

directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums.


Use of Non-GAAP Measures 

U.S. securities laws

require that when

we publish any

non-GAAP measures, we

disclose the reason

for using these

non-GAAP 

measures and provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The presentation of Group Adjusted EBITDA 

is

a

non-GAAP

measure.

We

provide

this

non-GAAP

measure

to

enhance

our

evaluation

and

understanding

of

our

financial 

performance

and

trends.

We

believe

that

this

measure

is

helpful

to

users

of

our

financial

information

understand

key

operating 

performance and

trends in our

business because

it excludes certain

non-cash expenses

(including depreciation

and amortization

and 

stock-based compensation charges) and income

and expenses that we consider once-off in nature. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Group

Adjusted

EBITDA

is

earnings

before

interest,

tax,

depreciation

and

amortization

(“EBITDA”),

adjusted

for

non-

operational transactions (including loss on disposal

of equity-accounted investments, gain related to

fair value adjustments to currency 

options), (earnings)

loss from

equity-accounted investments,

stock-based compensation

charges and

once-off

items. Once-off

items 

represents non-recurring income and

expense items, including

costs related to

acquisitions and transactions consummated

or ultimately 

not pursued.

Lease expenses

which were

previously excluded

from the

calculation of

Group Adjusted

EBITDA have

now been

included in 

the calculation. This

change is in response

to comments received from

the staff of the

SEC in March 2024

regarding our non-GAAP 

financial reporting. Comparative information has been adjusted to conform

Once-off items are non-recurring in nature, however, certain

items may be reported in

multiple quarters. For instance, transaction 

costs include costs incurred related to acquisitions and

transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. The transactions can span 

multiple

quarters,

for

instance

in

fiscal


we

incurred

significant

transaction

costs

related

to

the

acquisition

of

Adumo

over

a 

number of quarters, and the transactions are generally non-recurring. 

(Income

recognized)

Expenses

incurred

related

to

closure

of

legacy

businesses

represents

(i)

gains

recognized

related

to

the 

release of

the foreign

currency translation

reserve on

deconsolidation

of a

subsidiary

and (ii)

costs incurred

related

to subsidiaries 

which we are

in the process of

deregistering/ liquidation and

therefore we consider

these costs non-operational

and ad hoc in

nature. 

Non-recurring revenue

not allocated

to segments

includes once

off revenue

recognized that

we believe

does not

relate to

either our 

Merchant

or

Consumer

divisions.

Employee

misappropriation

of

company

funds

represents

a

once-off

loss

incurred.

Indirect

tax 

provision includes non-recurring indirect taxes which have been provided related to prior periods following an on-going investigation 

from a tax authority. We

incurred separation costs related to the termination of certain senior-level employees, including an executive 

officer and

senior managers,

during the

fiscal year

and we consider

these specific

terminations to

be of

a non-recurring

nature. The 

legacy processing

adjustments represents

amounts we

identified during

fiscal 2022

related to

prior periods

that are

payable to

third 

parties. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At June 30,

2024, our unrestricted

cash and cash

equivalents were $59.1

million and comprised

of ZAR-denominated

balances 

of

ZAR

961.6

million

($52.9

million),

U.S.

dollar-denominated

balances

of

$4.5

million,

and

other

currency

deposits,

primarily 

Botswana pula, of

$1.7 million, all

amounts translated at

exchange rates applicable as

of June 30,

2024\. The increase in

our unrestricted 

cash balances from June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a positive contribution from our Merchant

and Consumer operations, the sale 

of

certain

Cell

C

prepaid

inventory

held,

higher

year

end

clearing

accounts

and

vendor

wallet

balances,

and

utilization

of

our 

borrowings facilities

to fund

certain components

of our

operations, which

was partially

offset by

the utilization

of cash

reserves to 

fund certain scheduled and

other repayments of our borrowings,

pay transaction related expenses,

purchase ATMs

and vaults, and to 

make an investment in working capital. 

We generally

invest any surplus cash held by our

South African operations in overnight

call accounts that we maintain at

South 

African banking institutions,

and any surplus

cash held by

our non-South African

companies in

U.S. dollar-denominated money market 

accounts.

Historically,

we have financed

most of our

operations, research and

development, working capital,

and capital expenditures,

as 

well

as

acquisitions

and

strategic

investments,

through

internally

generated

cash

and

our

financing

facilities.

When

considering 

whether to borrow under our financing

facilities, we consider the cost

of capital, cost of financing, opportunity cost

of utilizing surplus 

cash and

availability of

tax efficient

structures to

moderate financing

costs. For

instance, in

fiscal 2022,

we obtained

loan facilities 

from RMB

to fund

a portion

of our

acquisition of

Connect.

Following the

acquisition of

Connect, we

now utilize

a combination

of 

short

and

long-term

facilities to

fund our

operating

activities and

a long-term

asset-backed

facility to

fund

the acquisition

of POS 

devices and

safe assets.

Refer to

Note 12

to our

consolidated financial

statements for

the year

ended June

30, 2024,

for additional 

information related to our borrowings.

Long-term borrowings 

We have aggregate long-term

borrowings

outstanding of ZAR 2.6 billion ($143.2 million translated at exchange rates as of June 

30, 2024) as

described in Note

12\. These borrowings

include outstanding

long-term borrowings

obtained by Lesaka

SA of ZAR

1.0 

billion,

including

accrued

interest,

which

was

used

to

partially

fund

the

acquisition

of

Connect.

The

Lesaka

SA

borrowing 

arrangements

were amended

in March

2023 to

include

a ZAR


million

revolving

credit facility.

We

used this

revolving

credit 

facility

during

the

year

ended

June

30,

2024,

and

ZAR

70.0

million

was

drawn

as

of

June

30,

2024,

with

the

remaining

balance 

available for utilization in the future. In contemplation of

the Connect transaction, Connect obtained total facilities of ZAR

1.3 billion, 

which were

utilized to

repay its existing

borrowings, to

fund a

portion of

its capital

expenditures and

to settle

obligations under

the 

transaction documents,

and which has

subsequently been

upsized for its

operational requirements

and has an

outstanding balance

as 

of June 30, 2024, of ZAR 1.2

billion, We also have a revolving credit facility, of ZAR 300.0 million which is utilized to fund a

portion 

of our merchant finance loans receivable book.

Restricted cash 

We

have credit

facilities with RMB

in order

to access cash

to fund

our ATMs

in South Africa.

Our cash, cash

equivalents and 

restricted cash

presented in

our consolidated

statement of

cash flows

as of

June 30,

2024, includes

restricted cash

of approximately 

$6.7

million

related

to

cash

withdrawn

from

our

debt

facility

to

fund

ATMs.

This

cash

may

only

be

used

to

fund

ATMs

and

is 

considered restricted as to use and therefore is classified as restricted cash on

our consolidated balance sheet. 

We

have also

entered into

cession and

pledge agreements

with Nedbank

related to

our Nedbank

credit facilities

and we

have 

ceded and

pledged certain

bank accounts

to Nedbank.

The funds

included in

these bank

accounts are

restricted as

they may

not be 

withdrawn without

the express permission

of Nedbank. Our

cash, cash equivalents

and restricted cash

presented in our

consolidated 

statement of cash flows as of June 30, 2024, includes restricted cash of approximately

$0.1 million that has been ceded and pledged.


Cash flows from operating activities 

Net cash

provided by

operating activities

during fiscal


was $28.8

million (ZAR

537.9 million)

compared to

$0.4 million 

(ZAR 7.4 million) during fiscal

2023\. Excluding the impact of

income taxes, our cash

provided by operating activities during

the fiscal 

2024 was positively impacted by the contribution from Merchant and

Consumer, the sale of Cell C inventory and temporary

working 

capital movements within

our merchant business

as a result

of quarter-end

transaction processing activities

closing on a

Sunday and 

which were settled in the following week, which was partially offset

by growth in our consumer finance loans receivable book. 

Net cash provided

by operating activities

during fiscal

2023 was $0.4

million (ZAR 7.4

million) compared

to net cash

utilized 

by

operating

activities

of

$37.2

million

(ZAR

565.3

million)

during

fiscal

2022.

Excluding

the

impact

of

income

taxes,

our

cash 

provided by operating activities

during fiscal 2023 was

impacted by the positive

contribution from Connect and

certain business within 

our consumer

business, which was

partially offset

by growth

in our consumer

and merchant finance

loans receivable

books. During 

fiscal 2023, we

observed fluctuations in

our working capital, primarily

within our merchant business,

as a result of

monthly changes 

in our inventory and prepayment

account balances as a result of

payments made to secure prepaid

airtime inventory.

Certain of these 

purchases were funded from our borrowing arrangements and the impact

of the funding is included in financing activities. 

During fiscal 2024,

we paid our

first provisional South

African tax payments

of $2.7 million

(ZAR 49.5 million)

related to our 


tax year. During fiscal 2024, we

also made our second

provisional South African tax

payments

of $2.9 million (ZAR

52.7 million 

related to our 2024

tax year and received

tax refunds of $0.04

million (ZAR 0.8 million).

We

also paid taxes totaling

$0.4 million in 

other tax jurisdictions, primarily in the Botswana.

related to our 

2023 tax year. During fiscal 2023,

we also made

our second provisional South

African tax payments of

$4.1 million (ZAR 76.1

million 

related to our

2023 tax year

and received

tax refunds of

$0.2 million (ZAR

3.8 million).

We

also paid taxes

totaling $0.4

million in 

other tax jurisdictions, primarily in the Botswana. 

During fiscal 2022,

we made our

first provisional South

African tax payments

of $0.6 million

(ZAR 9.1 million)

related to our 


tax year. During fiscal 2022, we

also made our second

provisional South African tax

payments

of $0.7 million (ZAR

10.9 million 

related to our 2022 tax year and made an additional tax payment of $0.001 million (ZAR

0.02 million) related to our 2021 tax year.

Our capital expenditures

for fiscal 2024,

2023 and 2022, are

discussed under “—Liquidity

and Capital Resources—Cash

flows 

from investing activities.” 

All of our capital expenditures

for the past three fiscal

years were funded through

internally-generated funds, except

for certain 

capital

expenditures

of

POS devices

and

safe

assets, made

by

Connect

which

were funded

through

the utilization

of asset-backed 

borrowings.

We

had

outstanding

capital commitments

as of

June 30,

2024,

of $0.3

million.

We

expect

to fund

these expenditures 

through

internally-generated

funds.

In

addition

to

these

capital

expenditures,

we

expect

that

capital

spending

for

fiscal


will 

include acquisition

of POS devices,

safe assets, vehicles,

computer and office

equipment, as well

as for our

ATM

infrastructure and 

branch

network

in

South

Africa.

These

assets

will

be

funded

through

the

use

of

internally-generated

funds

and

our

asset-backed 

borrowing arrangement.
