\. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Prior to December 31, 2020, while implementing underground gravity drainage, or UGD, projects for Allegheny, we gained specialized know-how and operational experience in evaluating, acquiring, operating and developing oil and gas properties, as well as expertise in designing, drilling and producing conventional oil wells. Based upon that know-how, we identified and acquired 45,246 gross acres, and 37,932 net acres, of mineral property interests in the State of Montana. We began drilling an exploratory well in Montana during May 2022. That well, named the Olfert 11-4 well, has not yet been completed or put into production. More recently, we are continuing our efforts to complete the Olfert 11-4 well and begin commercial production. We have also developed relationships with Texakoma Exploration and Production, LLC, or Texakoma, and Erehwon Oil & Gas, LLC, or Erehwon, designed to develop our acquired mineral property acreage. We also have raised $2,034,000 from accredited investors pursuant to a participation agreement to fund the development of up to three wells in the Midfork oil field in Montana. The first well, Reddig 11-21, has been drilled and is in the process of being put into production. We are continually attempting to raise additional funds to develop our other mineral property interests we have purchased. We also have a 50% interest in the Cat Creek oil field, located in Montana. Our various projects and relationships are described in more detail below. Our ability to secure additional funding will determine whether we can achieve any future production for the acreage, and if we can secure such financing, the pace of field development. 

Development Agreement with Texakoma Exploration and Production, LLC

The agreement with Texakoma described in Item 1 began to produce revenue from the test wells in the first calendar quarter of 2024, but pending access to a saltwater disposal well (“SWD”), neither of the two wells have been put into full production. A third well was drilled by Texakoma in July but also is waiting for SWD access before being put into production. We expect that during late September, access to SWD will be attained and all drilled wells will be completed and put into production shortly thereafter. With SWD well access, we expected that Texakoma will continue its drilling program to complete seven more wells. Texakoma will provide the capital required to drill those additional wells. Once all ten wells are drilled and producing, we expected that the 15% net working interest held by the Company will generate enough revenue to cover our ongoing operating expenses. Until we receive adequate funding from the Texakoma agreement described above, any cash needed for operations and oil field expansion and development will most likely come from the sale of our debt and equity securities. 

Hell Creek Crude, LLC Midfork Field Production Well

In December 2023, we entered into a Participation Agreement, through Hell Creek Crude, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, Erehwon, and various accredited investors. The Participation Agreement provided us with $2,034,000 of capital to acquire certain leases and to drill the Reddig 11-21 well in the Midfork Field in Montana. Several of the investors contributed $575,000 of our convertible debt, plus accrued interest of $73,317, which indebtedness was canceled and included as investments under the Participation Agreement to be repaid from oil sales from the well. 

Until the total of the $2,682,317 in cash, notes and accrued interest is repaid to the various investors under the terms of the Participation Agreement, the net working interest payments from the Participation Agreement will be split between the various investors and HCC and Erehwon, collectively, on a 90%/10% basis. After the repayment to the investors, the split between the investors, on one hand, and HCC and Erehwon, on the other hand, will be on a 50%/50% basis. After the development well is drilled under the Participation Agreement, the investors will have the option to invest in up to two additional wells in the field.

Olfert 11-4 Montana Well

The Olfert 11-4 was drilled in May 2022 and has not been completed or put into production. The well encountered what we believe are economic levels of oil but also encountered saltwater intrusion which requires us to access a proximate SWD well to economically dispose of the saltwater in the well. We are optimistic that in conjunction with attaining a SWD to support the Reddig 11-21 well in the Midfork Field and the Texakoma wells, the Olfert 11-4 well will have access to that SWD well to dispose of encountered saltwater and be economical to complete and put into production. As of May 31, 2023, we took a long-term asset impairment loss with respect to our long-term assets, primarily comprised of the Olfert 11-4 assets.

Additional Acreage North of the Fort Peck Reservation

We are in the process of raising $7.5 million to drill three exploratory wells by selling units of West Fork Resources, LLC. The purpose of the package is to prove up portions of our over 30,000 acres of mineral rights located north of the Fort Peck Reservation.

We recognized revenues and direct costs totaling $36,482 and $0, respectively through our interest in oil and gas sales for the year ended May 31, 2024. We had no similar revenues or direct costs during the year ended May 31, 2023 During the years ending May 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred operating expenses of $3,426,709 and $7,120,223, respectively. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day-to-day operation of our business, the preparation and filing of our required public reports and stock option compensation expense. The decrease in expenses for the year ended May 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily attributable a long-term asset impairment loss which we determined may not be recoverable totaling $4,299,274, recorded during fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, decreases in other professional fees including public relations and advisory services offset by a $940,940 increase in stock-based compensation. 

During the year ended May 31, 2024, we recognized other income and expenses of $175,000 related to the sale of drilling equipment, $727,901 offset by $285,412 in direct lease acquisition costs related to payments required under the Texakoma Development Agreement, and an undisclosed payment related to a confidential legal settlement. During the year ended May 31, 2023, we recognized other income and expenses comprised of (i) the $122,682 we received from the Employee Retention Credit established by the CARES Act, and (ii) we recognized a $287,123 impairment loss on our Cat Creek equity investment in addition to the previous $95,454 equity method loss recorded during the quarters.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The process of preparing consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of liabilities and stockholders equity/(deficit) at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include estimates related to purchase price allocation. Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances could result in a material change to the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions.

Going Concern

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. We have routinely incurred losses since inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit. We have recently received loans from accredited investors to fund our operations. There is no assurance that such financing will be available in the future to meet our operating needs. This situation raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the one-year period after the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Our management has undertaken steps to improve operations, with the goal of sustaining operations for the next twelve months and beyond. These steps include an ongoing effort to raise funds through the issuance of debt to fund our well development program and maintain operations. We have attracted and retained key personnel with significant experience in the industry. At the same time, in an effort to control costs, we have required a number of our personnel to multi-task and cover a wider range of responsibilities in an effort to restrict the growth of our headcount. There can be no assurance that we can successfully accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that we will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of us to continue as a going concern.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party.
