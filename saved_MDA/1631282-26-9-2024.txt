Our company’s acoustic technologies and products are widely applied across various industries and fields, including acoustic industrial applications, acoustic agriculture, acoustic medicine, acoustic health, and acoustic IoT technologies.

Acoustic High-Tech is a new field that integrates fundamental acoustic theory with artificial intelligence to collect and process acoustic data and address various challenges. Datasea utilizes advanced technologies in this domain, combining basic acoustic theories with AI to create a robust technology system centered around the effects of research and application of non-audible mechanical wave effects. This includes leveraging ultrasonic technology for sterilization, which effectively combats viruses and prevents infections. The technology exploits the mechanical, thermal, and cavitation effects of ultrasound. When microorganisms, including viruses like the coronavirus, are exposed to ultrasound, they experience intense vibrational strains that disrupt their outer shells and internal RNA. The rapid movement of protons caused by the ultrasound ultimately destroys microbial structures, eliminating harmful pathogens.

Especially in the field of ultrasonic technology, we utilize the cavitation, thermal, and mechanical effects of ultrasound to address various application needs, including disinfection, sterilization, crop drying, safety monitoring, skincare, and medical wellness. For example, in the field of ultrasonic disinfection, when ultrasound stimulates microorganisms (including coronaviruses), it causes significant vibrational strain, disrupting the virus’s outer shell and internal RNA. Ultimately, through a combination of mechanical destruction, cavitation effects, and advanced oxidative processes, pathogenic microorganisms are eliminated. This method provides a broad-spectrum, non-selective disinfection alternative to antibiotics.


Leveraging Datasea’s cutting-edge acoustic high-tech combined with AI technology, we have successfully developed a series of ultrasonic disinfection products. These include the acoustic health series ultrasonic disinfectors, ultrasonic sterilizers and purifiers for restrooms, bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and pets, as well as innovative non-contact ultrasonic skin repair devices.

Competition

It is essential to recognize that acoustic technology is a broad and diverse field. Different acoustic attributes find extensive applications in various niche sectors, and distinct competitive landscapes exist across different application areas. Major tech companies like Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and others have also invested in acoustic-related technologies, potentially impacting future market dynamics. We anticipate that competition in the markets we engage in will continue to intensify as existing competitors enhance or broaden their product offerings, and as new companies enter the market. Moreover, our ability to compete effectively depends on various factors, including technological innovation, product safety, as well as attributes such as price and brand reputation.

Going Concern

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of approximately $11.38 million and $9.48 million, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $39.44 million as of June 30, 2024, and negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately $6.40 million and $3.14 million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The historical operating results indicate the Company has recurring losses from operations which raise the question related to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern although the range of such recurring operating losses has narrowed in recent years. There can be no assurance the Company will become profitable or obtain necessary financing for its business and investments or that it will be able to continue in business and investments. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $181,262.

We continue to bring in additional investors to support our company’s research and development, marketing and operations. On August 1, 2023, the Company entered into two separate subscription agreements with a certain non-U.S. investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the investor agreed to purchase an aggregate of 4,760,000 shares of common stock price at a $1.2 per share purchase price. Such shares must be held for a period of 365 days. In accordance with such two agreements, Investor shall pay a total purchase price of $5,712,000 in RMB, at an amount of RMB 40,000,000, no later than September 30, 2023. On September 21, the Company has received all of the payment of RMB 40,000,000.


On August 15, 2023, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with a non-U.S. investor to purchase an aggregate of 2,962,963 shares of common stock price at a $1.35 per share purchase price, with a total subscription price of $4,000,000. The shares must be held for a period of 180 days. On September 13, 2023, our Company announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.40 per share, for net proceeds of $1,635,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. On July 3, 2024, we closed an offering for net proceeds of $2.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. We believe these fundings demonstrate our investors’ confidence in our strategy and busines

The Company recorded $0.83 million gain on disposal of the subsidiary, which was the difference between the selling price of US$0.28 and the carrying value of the negative net assets of $2.34 million of the disposal entity, and further netting off the inter-company receivables from Zhangxun of $1.48 million due to uncertainty of the repayment from Zhangxun. In addition, the Company incurred an additional $32,236 intercompany receivables from Zhangxun during the three months ended September 30, 2023, for which, the Company also netted off with gain on disposal of Zhangxun. 

If deemed necessary, management could seek to raise additional funds by the way of introducing strategic investors or private or public offerings, or by obtaining loans from banks or others, to support the Company’s research and development, procurement, marketing and daily operation. However, there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. We may be required to pursue sources of additional capital through various means, including debt or equity financings.

Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in the future capital transactions may be more favorable for new investors. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets and our history of losses, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may be required to cease operations.

Sustainable operation can help enterprises improve operating efficiency, enhance the competitiveness of enterprises, and enhance the market share of enterprises.

Sustainable operation can help enterprises better control risks, reduce operating costs, and ensure the safety of enterprises

Sustainable operation can help enterprises enhance their social image and enhance their sense of social responsibility.

Sustainable operation can help enterprises better grasp market opportunities, grasp market trends, and achieve a win-win situation between enterprises and society.

Gross margin is 2.0% and 3.7% for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to the lower gross profit margin of 5G AI multimodal digital service.

Measures to improve the gross profit margin of enterprises:


From the perspective of market prospects, according to the prediction of Global Association for Mobile Communication Systems, by 2025, the number of 5G connections in China will exceed the sum of North America and Europe, ranking first in the world. The number of 5G connections will reach 460 million, accounting for 28% of the total connections in the country. 5G messaging has become an international standard.2 China will become one of the largest single contributors to the global growth of mobile internet users in the coming years, accounting for nearly 20% of the total global increase.

Combining the advantages of “Internet of Things+” intelligent terminals and 5G messaging industry chain, Shuhai Beijing is advancing with the time, taking the train of the 5G era, and developing 5G Multimodal communication/phone top up business. At this stage, Shuhai Beijing is carrying out the development, operation and promotion services of the Internet of Things market and increasing the effective combination of resources with Mobile Internet enterprises and the Internet of Things industrial chain.

In 2023, the 5G AI multimodal digital business of Shuhai Information accounts for a relatively big proportion of the total revenue, because, at this stage, the business belongs to the early stage of the development, operation and promotion services of the Internet of Things market, and the investment in all aspects is large. In addition, the gross profit of the traffic top up business is generally low. As a result, the annual gross profit margin decreased from the previous year. The Company’s focus in this business is to integrate new resources, expand new businesses related to 5G, combine the Company’s years of deep cultivation and accumulation in 5G news, and take this opportunity to open up more 5G-related businesses to increase the Company’s revenue and new business. 

In China’s mature and transparent market today, gross margins on services are far greater than those on hardware sales. The improvement of gross profit margin shows that the Company’s measures to improve gross profit margin are gradually showing effect: 1) costs will be reduced by economic scale over a larger number of customers base and the increase in production; 2) the Company, by adopting the differentiation strategy, grows brand recognition and customer loyalty, strengthening the Company’s pricing power; 3) As the scale of 5G AI multimodal communicaiton traffic top up services and the number of serviced customers, along with service quality, continue to improve, customized and value-added services, as well as service fees, will gradually increase. This will boost the profitability of the Company’s related businesses.
