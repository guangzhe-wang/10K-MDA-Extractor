. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Background

Since June 2022, the Company has focused its efforts on real estate operations. We have no involvement in any aspect of the cannabis industry. In February 2023, we leased a commercial building from a company controlled by our CEO and subleased a portion of the building to a third party. The term of the sublease was one year and the annual rent was $30,000. Effective March of 2024, the sublease became a month-to-month lease for $2,500 per month.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Results of Operations for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023

Revenue and Cost of Sales

For the year ended May 31, 2024, the Company generated total revenue of $30,000 from renting. The cost of sales for the year ended May 31, 2024, was $30,067.

For the year ended May 31, 2023, the Company generated total revenue of $10,000. The cost of sales for the year ended May 31, 2023, was $9,166.

The increase in revenues and cost of sale is due to the fact that the Company started its renting business in February 2023. In other words, there were twelve months’ revenue for the year ended May 31, 2024, but four months’ revenue for the year ended May 31, 2023. The cost of sales increase aligns with the increase in revenue.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the year ended May 31, 2024, were $256,870. The operating expenses for the year ended May 31, 2024, included professional fees of $77,940; depreciation expense of $4,244 and general and administrative expenses of $174,686.

The decrease in operating expenses is related to the decrease of the professional fees due to significance of business activities and SEC filings in the year ended May 31, 2023.

The significant increase in other expenses is due to the loss on settlement of debt resulting from the Company prepaying for its lease liabilities with convertible notes that were recorded at their fair value, which were recorded at a premium, during the year ended May 31, 2024.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Leases

The Company follows the accounting for leases under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 Lease Accounting and determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases result in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities (short term and long term) being recorded on the Company’s balance sheets.

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowings over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when 

it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Rent Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes rent revenue from the lease of its sub-leased properties in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. The sub-lease is categorized as an operating lease according to ASC criteria for the lease definitions. Rent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, reflecting the pattern of the economic benefits derived from the lease.

The Company’s leases generally have fixed rental payments over the lease term, with occasional escalations based on predetermined factors. Rent revenue is recognized monthly as the lessor fulfills its obligations under the lease agreement.

Any lease incentives or concessions provided to lessees, such as rent-free periods or tenant improvement allowances, are recognized as a reduction of rent revenue over the lease term.

For the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized rent revenue of $30,000 and $10,000, respectively, from its lease agreements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

There have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended May 31, 2024, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.
