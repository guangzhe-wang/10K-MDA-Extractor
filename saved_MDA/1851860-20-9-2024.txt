ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Overview

We are engaged in the development, marketing, manufacturing, acquisition, operation and sale of a broad spectrum of nutritional and related products with an emphasis on health and wellness. Structured as a global holding company, we are executing a buy-and-build strategy with serial accretive acquisitions creating a vertically integrated company. To drive growth and earnings, we are developing proprietary products as well as acquiring other profitable companies, encompassing brands, manufacturing and distribution channels.

We also operate a network platform in the affiliate marketing space. Affiliate marketing is an advertising model in which a product vendor compensates third-party digital marketers to generate traffic or leads for the product vendor’s products and services. The third-party digital marketers are referred to as affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the products being sold by the product vendor.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary DSO manufactures, sells and owns the Smart for Life brand of natural health and wellness meal replacement products. The brand includes proprietary hunger suppressing functional foods that are designed to work with the body’s natural ability to lose weight. It also develops premium supplements and commodities that will promote optimal health and wellness. DSO has over 15 years of experience providing high-quality products to premium retail locations and companies. Its branded vitamins and supplements are also being sold through Amazon, and this sales channel is becoming a major contributor to the growth of the brand online.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary GSP is a sports nutrition company. It offers nutritional supplements for athletes and active lifestyle consumers through a variety of wellness solutions and delivery methods, including powders, tablets and soft gels that are formulated to support energy and performance; nutrition and wellness; and focus and clarity. GSP operates within the 36,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Riviera Beach, Florida that is also occupied by DSO. This section of the facility primarily focuses on the contract manufacturing of vitamins and supplements, with a particular emphasis on the production of tablets, capsules and powders, along with turn-key solutions for packaging these health and wellness products in a wide variety of bottles, jars, sachets and stick packs.

We also own 49% of First Health, which is primarily engaged in the development and distribution of a wide variety of nutritional products, including antioxidant rich supplements, plant-based protein, alkalizing nutrients and products designed for weight management. First Health owns the Greens First line of branded products which have been specifically marketed to the healthcare provider sector. These vitamins and supplements have been sold on a business-to-business basis, direct-to-consumer, as well as sold utilizing an international medical distribution company.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary Nexus operates a cost per action/cost per acquisition network. This network consists of hundreds of digital marketers who stand ready to market products introduced to the Nexus network. The cost per action/cost per acquisition model is where digital marketers are paid for an action (e.g., a product sale or lead generation) that is taken as a direct result of their marketing efforts. Through the digital marketer’s method of marketing, the digital marketer sends traffic to one of the product vendor’s offers listed on the network. 

Recent Developments

Ceautamed Transaction and Related Transactions

On January 29, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with First Health and Ceautamed, along with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Wellness Watchers Global, LLC and Greens First Female LLC, pursuant to which we agreed to sell 51% of the assets of Ceautamed and its subsidiaries to First Health for an aggregate price of $3,486,233, consisting of (i) $210,993.50 paid to our creditors for outstanding debt owed and (ii) $3,275,239 in the form of the assumption of certain assumed liabilities (as defined in the asset purchase agreement), including the assumption of certain debt and the release of Ceautamed and its subsidiaries from such liabilities.

In connection with the asset purchase agreement, we also entered into a limited liability company agreement, or the LLC Agreement, pursuant to which First Health was organized. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the voting members of First Health are Joseph X. Xiras, Stuart Benson, and Ryan Benson, each with a 17% voting interest in First Health. We will also maintain a 49% non-voting ownership interest in First Health. The voting members of First Health have the option to purchase such 49% non-voting ownership interest for $1 upon notice to us pursuant to the LLC Agreement.


Loan Agreement

On March 5, 2024, our company and DSO, as borrowers, entered into a loan agreement with Abbsi, LLC, or Abbsi, for a loan of up to $500,000 and issued a promissory note to Abbsi in the principal amount of $250,000. Pursuant to the loan agreement and note, Abbsi is providing funds directly to various vendors and service providers of DSO. During the term of the loan, Abbsi agreed to pay DSO’s suppliers directly, or reimburse us if DSO’s suppliers have been paid directly by us, for all costs associated with the production and sale of our branded products by Abbsi, as well as payroll costs attributable to the sale of such products. All such costs shall be reimbursed directly by us or applied as a reduction to the principal amount due under the loan agreement and note. The note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum and has a term of 60-months, if not prepaid earlier, and shall otherwise be due and payable as provided in the note. The loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty and is secured by a security interest in all of DSO’s assets. As of the date hereof, Abbsi has advanced $250,000 under the loan.

The loan agreement also provides that, for so long as any amounts due under the note remain outstanding and subject to a cap equal to the principal amount of the loan, Abbsi shall be entitled to receive 20% of the annual positive cash flow generated by DSO, which shall be calculated on an annualized basis. Calculation of such payment shall be made contemporaneously with the end of each fiscal quarter and shall be paid concurrently with our quarterly or annual filings with the SEC. 

Sale and Leaseback Agreement

On March 6, 2024, we entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with Efraim Elias, or the Purchaser, related to BSNM’s Doral, Florida production facility, or the Facility. Under the sale and leaseback agreement, we sold BSNM to the Purchaser for a purchase price of $1.00 and agreed to lease the Facility from the Purchaser. The lease shall expire on March 6, 2074 and either party may extend the lease for up to ten additional one-year periods.

In addition, we agreed to enter into a management services agreement, pursuant to which GSP shall (i) be obligated to make certain future payments to the Purchaser; (ii) assume and pay all existing and future liabilities of the Facility; (iii) manage the operations and affairs of the Facility; and (iv) be entitled to all revenues of the Facility and transactions in respect of all assets of the Facility, in its sole discretion. As of the date of this report, the management services agreement has not yet been signed.

The sale and leaseback agreement includes a right of first offer, pursuant to which we have a right to repurchase the Facility in the event that one or both parties determine that the Purchaser cannot maintain title ownership to the Facility and/or fulfill all of its obligations under the sale and leaseback agreement or the management services agreement. The terms of any such repurchase shall be in our sole discretion. The Purchaser may not transfer the Facility to any other party.

Securities Purchase Agreement

On April 3, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Purely Optimal Nutrition Inc., or Purely Optimal, and Tan Enterprises, Inc., Availiant Holdings Corporation, Dannel Tan, Jason Kwan and Timur Kim, or the Sellers, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Purely Optimal, a health supplement brand, from the Sellers for an aggregate purchase price of $11,965,966.10, or the Purchase Price, consisting of (i) $7,859,579.66 in cash and (ii) $4,106,386.44 payable as 18,414 newly issued shares of series D convertible preferred stock, a new series of preferred stock, subject to certain adjustments described below.

The Purchase Price is based upon a six times multiple of an estimated EBITDA of $1,467,073.35 for the twelve-month period ending on November 30, 2023, or the Reconstructed EBITDA. The Purchase Price will be adjusted upwards or downwards based upon the difference between (i) six times the Reconstructed EBITDA and the Purchase Price and (ii) the Estimated Inventory Payment (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) and the actual amount of Inventory (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) on the closing date. In addition, the cash portion of the Purchase Price will be decreased by the amount of any outstanding indebtedness of Purely Optimal for borrowed money existing as of the closing date and any unpaid transaction expenses.

The securities purchase agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a covenant that the Sellers will not compete with the business of Purely Optimal for a period of two years following closing. The securities purchase agreement also contains mutual indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties and failure to perform covenants or obligations contained in the securities purchase agreement. In the case of the indemnification provided by the Sellers with respect to breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties, the Sellers will only become liable for indemnified losses if the amount exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, whereupon the Sellers will be liable for all losses relating back to the first dollar, provided that the liability of the Sellers for breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties shall not exceed thirty five (35%) of the Purchase Price and each Seller’s aggregate liability for the breach of fundamental representations shall be limited to the Purchase Price.

The closing of the securities purchase agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the completion of accounting and legal due diligence investigations; the receipt of all authorizations, consents and approvals of all governmental authorities and third parties; the release of any liens against any of the assets of Purely Optimal; our obtaining the requisite acquisition financing; and delivery of all documents required for the transfer of the equity interests of Purely Optimal to us.


Warrant Solicitation

On May 30, 2024, we entered into warrant solicitation inducement letters with the holders of warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 183,370 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.64 issued on December 4, 2023, or the Existing Warrants, pursuant to which the holders agreed to exercise the Existing Warrants for cash at a reduced exercise price of $4.25 per share, or for gross proceeds of $779,322.50 in the aggregate. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the Existing Warrants for cash, we agreed to issue to the holders new warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 550,110 shares of common stock, or the New Warrants.

On June 3, 2024, the closing of this transaction was completed, and we issued the New Warrants. The New Warrants are exercisable for a period of eighteen months at an initial exercise price of $4.25 per share and may be exercised on a cashless basis if at the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the resale of, the shares issuable upon exercise of the New Warrants. The exercise price will be subject to customary adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and similar recapitalization transactions. The New Warrants also contain a beneficial ownership limitation which provides that we shall not effect any exercise, and a holder shall not have the right to exercise, any portion of a New Warrant to the extent that, after giving effect to the exercise, such holder (together with such holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares issuable upon the exercise. This limitation may be waived (up to a maximum of 9.99%) by a holder in its sole discretion upon not less than sixty-one days’ prior notice to us.

H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC acted as warrant inducement agent and financial advisor in connection with the transaction and received a cash fee equal to 7.5% of the gross proceeds, a management fee equal to 1% of the gross proceeds and reimbursement of certain expenses. After these fees, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $458,473. In addition, the Company issued to certain designees of H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC warrants to purchase 13,753 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.3125 per share, which such warrants will have the same terms of the New Warrants (other than the exercise price).

Debt Conversions and Creation of Series C Preferred Stock

Subsequent to December 31, 2023, we entered into conversion agreements with certain lenders, pursuant to which such lenders converted an aggregate of $15,318,716 of debt and interest owed by us to such lenders in exchange for an aggregate of 6,141,229 shares of common stock and 36,506.81 shares of series C preferred stock. The conversions were completed in multiple transactions at a price per underlying share of common stock that was at least equal to the lower of (i) the official closing price as reflected on Nasdaq.com immediately preceding signing of the conversion agreement or (ii) the average official closing price as reflected on Nasdaq.com for the five trading days immediately preceding signing of the conversion agreement.

In connection with these debt conversions, we filed a certificate of designation with the Nevada Secretary of State on March 1, 2024 to create a new series of preferred stock designated as series C preferred stock. Pursuant to the certificate of designation, we designated 200,000 shares of our preferred stock as series C preferred stock. Following is a summary of the material terms of the series C preferred stock:

Dividend Rights. Holders of series C preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends in the same form as dividends paid on shares of the common stock only when and if such dividends are paid on shares of common stock. No other dividends shall be paid on shares of series C preferred stock.

Liquidation Rights. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of series C preferred stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of our company the same amount that a holder of common stock would receive if the series C preferred stock were fully converted (disregarding for such purposes any conversion limitations) to common stock, which amounts shall be paid prior to all holders of common stock and pari passu with all holders of our series B preferred stock.


Voting Rights. The series C preferred stock shall vote together with the common stock on an as-converted basis.

Conversion Rights. Each share of series C preferred stock is convertible, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder thereof, into that number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the stated value of such share of series C preferred stock ($100) by the conversion price. The conversion price is $7.00 (subject to adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations and certain fundamental transactions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall not effect any conversion, and a holder shall not have the right to convert, any portion of the series C preferred stock to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion, such holder (together with such holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares issuable upon the conversion. This limitation may be waived (up to a maximum of 9.99%) by the holder and in its sole discretion, upon not less than sixty-one days’ prior notice to us.

No Redemption. The series C preferred stock is not redeemable.

Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance

Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:

Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we will be permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.235 billion or more, (iii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


Discontinued Operations

As noted above, on March 6, 2024, we entered into a sale and leaseback agreement relating to BSNM. As a result, the financial results and balances have been classified as discontinued operations within this report and the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

BSNM is a nutraceutical contract manufacturer that specializes in a wide variety of products to fill its client’s needs, from the private labelling of vitamins, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, sport nutrition and broad-spectrum nutritional supplements.

Results of Operations

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022

The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, both in dollars and as a percentage of our revenues.

Revenues. Our total revenues decreased by $7,676,737, or 48.27%, to $8,225,792 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $15,902,529 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such decrease was primarily due a lack of cash to fund the purchase of ingredients leading to our inability to meet production needs. The lack of ingredients inventory impacted our ability to meet the production needs of contract manufacturing clients as well as the sales of our own products. The lack of adequate cash also caused us to significantly reduce our advertising and marketing efforts to promote our products with online retailers.


Our nutraceutical business generates revenue from the sales of nutritional and related products. Revenues from our nutraceutical business (products) decreased by $4,603,673, or 36.92%, to $7,863,977 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $12,467,650 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to our cash constraints and our inability to pay for raw materials used in the production of both branded and contract manufacturing products. The decreased revenues were the result of a decrease in the volume of products sold and not due to pricing changes.

Our digital marketing business generates revenues when sales of listed products are sold by product vendors through our network as a result of the marketing efforts of digital marketers. Revenues from our digital marketing business (advertising), which is operated by Nexus, decreased by $3,073,064, or 89.47%, to $361,815 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $3,434,879 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenue is attributable to our cash constraints and the impact it had with our affiliate advertisers.

Cost of revenues. Our total cost of revenues decreased by $5,676,324, or 52.50%, to $5,135,685 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $10,812,009 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such decrease is directly related to the decrease in revenues.

Cost of revenues for our nutraceutical business consist of ingredients, packaging materials, freight, and labor associated with the production of various products. Cost of revenues for our nutraceutical business (products) decreased by $3,396,179, or 41.16%, to $4,854,554 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $8,250,733 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such decrease was primarily due to the cash constraints described above. As a percentage of product revenues, cost of revenues for product sales decreased from 66.18% in 2022 to 61.73% in 2023 due to rising prices for raw materials and the utilization of existing inventory items.

Cost of revenues for our digital marketing business consist of commissions and bonuses paid to digital marketers. Cost of revenues from our digital marketing business (advertising) decreased by $2,280,145, or 89.02%, to $281,131 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2,561,276 for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a percentage of advertising revenues, cost of revenues for advertising sales was 77.70% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 74.57% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Gross profit. As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit decreased by $2,000,413 or 39.30%, to $3,090,107 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $5,090,520 for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a percentage of revenues, our gross profit increased from 32.01% in 2022 to 37.57% in 2023.

General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses, bad debts, rent expense, insurance and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by $1,079,723, or 20.23% to $4,258,202 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $5,337,925 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such decrease was primarily due to decreased rates for insurance, a significant reduction in advertising spending as discussed above. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased from 33.57% in 2022 to 51.77% in 2023.

Compensation. Our compensation expenses include both cash and non-cash items, including salaries plus related payroll taxes. Our compensation expenses decreased by $606,620, or 9.84% to $5,561,017 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $6,167,637 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such decrease was primarily due to the temporary closure of the production facilities during 2023 due to the cash constraints discussed above, offset by the increased stock based compensation recognized in 2023 of $797,535. As a percentage of revenues, compensation expenses increased from 38.78% in 2022 to 67.60% in 2023.

Professional services. Our professional services expenses consist primarily of investor relations, consulting, advisory, legal and audit expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our professional services expenses increased by $98,207, or 4.54% to $2,263,405 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2,165,198 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such increase was primarily due to advisor fees related to our compliance with Nasdaq. As a percentage of revenues, professional services expenses increased from 13.62% in 2022 to 27.52% in 2023.

Consulting fee related party. Consulting fees to related parties decreased by $1,424,513, or 96.83%, to $46,686 for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $1,471,199 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is associated with the decreased financing arrangements provided by the related party during 2023\. As a percentage of revenues, consulting fees to related parties decreased from 9.25% in 2022 to 0.57% in 2023.


Impairment of intangible assets. We recognized an impairment of intangible assets of $5,843,501, or 71.04% of revenues, during 2023 related to the intangible assets associated with Nexus of $2,897,737, an impairment of the license agreement associated with GSP of $342,531, an impairment of the intangible assets of Ceautamed of $2,603,233. We did not recognize such an impairment during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $2,273,288, or 27.64% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $1,899,542, or 11.94% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in amortization is associated with the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Ceautamed.

Total other income (expense). We had $3,964,614 in total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to total other expense, net, of $16,231,420 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of interest expense of $4,634,839, offset by other income of $400,397 and gain on debt extinguishment of $269,828. The other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of interest expense of $15,689,565, initial public offering expenses of $702,420, and other expense of $474, offset by a gain on debt extinguishment of $161,039.

Loss from discontinued operations. We incurred a loss on discontinued operations of $1,555,135 and $1,795,415 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease is attributable to the reduction of workforce and related compensation as production slowed.

Net loss. As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had a net loss of $22,675,741 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $29,977,816 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $7,302,075, or 24.36%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2023, we had cash of $188,596. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from operations, bank borrowings and sales of our securities. Since our inception in 2017, we have experienced losses and as a result have continued to use cash in our operations. We have been dependent upon financing activities as we implement our acquisition strategy.

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a working capital deficiency of approximately $19.7 million and an accumulated deficit of $67.7 million. Additionally, we had a net loss of $22.7 million, and cash used in operations of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures over the next 12 months. Management has implemented restructuring activities, including staff reductions, a subsequent event sale of BSNM, and a subsequent event sale of Ceautamed’s assets. Accordingly, we will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of common stock and/or debt financing in order to implement our business plan. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitation on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. There is no assurance that we will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Initial Public Offering

On February 16, 2022, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Dawson James Securities, Inc., as representative of the several underwriters named on Schedule I thereto, relating to our initial public offering of units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, a series A warrant to purchase one share of common stock and a series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, we agreed to sell 457 units to the underwriters, at a purchase price per unit of $28,665.00 (the offering price to the public of $31,500.00 per unit minus the underwriters’ discount), and also agreed to grant to the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 69 additional shares of common stock, up to 69 additional series A warrants, and/or up to 69 additional series B warrants, in any combination thereof, at a purchase price to the public of $31,437.00 per share and $31.50 per warrant, less underwriting discounts and commissions, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.

On February 18, 2022, the closing of our initial public offering was completed. At the closing, the underwriters partially exercised the option and purchased 66 series A warrants and 66 series B warrants. Therefore, we sold 457 shares of common stock, 523 series A warrants and 523 series B warrants for total gross proceeds of $14,404,128. After deducting the underwriting commission and expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $12,684,739. We used the proceeds of the offering to pay off certain debt and used the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The series A warrants are exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the issuance date at an exercise price equal to $22,050.00 per share and may be exercised on a cashless basis if the issuance of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not covered by an effective registration statement.

The series B warrants are exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the issuance date at an exercise price equal to $31,500.00 per share and may be exercised on a cashless basis, whereby the holder will receive one share of common stock for each series B warrant exercised. As of December 31, 2023, 457 of the series B warrants were exercised on a cashless basis and we issued 457 shares of common stock upon such exercise. 


Private Placement of Common Stock and Prefunded Warrants 

On December 8, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued to the investors an aggregate of 407 shares of common stock and prefunded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 500 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000,000, or $1,102.50 per underlying share.

The investors were also previously issued warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 3,908 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $19,687.50, which contain a full ratchet anti-dilution adjustment provision. As a result of the issuance of shares at $1,102.50 per share, the exercise price of these warrants was reduced to $1,102.50 per share and the number of shares underlying the warrants was increased to 68,024 shares in accordance with the terms of the warrants. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the investors then agreed to amend and restate the terms of the warrants to, among other things, remove full ratchet anti-dilution adjustment provision.

Dawson James Securities, Inc. acted as placement agent in connection with the private placement described above and received a cash commission of $90,000 and warrants for the purchase of 73 shares of common at an exercise price of $1,102.50.

Outstanding Debt

We have historically funded our acquisitions and operations through debt agreements. We have outstanding debt of $12,364,800 at December 31, 2023, with $10,616,114 of principal payments due within the next 12 months. We have not generated cash flow from operations and the repayment of debt is dependent on raising new equity transactions and new debt financings. Between January 1, 2024 and September 20, 2024, we have converted $12,901,227 of the debt into equity instruments. There is no assurance that we will be successful with future financings, and the inability to secure financings may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The following is a roll-forward of the debt balances for the year ended December 31, 2023:

Please see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for a complete description of the terms of our outstanding debt.

Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under the loans described above, the operating leases described under Item 2 “Properties” and pricing/margin structures for products established with our clients. We do not have any purchase obligations with any suppliers.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies

The following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:

Revenue Recognition. We evaluate and recognize revenue by: identifying the contract(s) with the customer; identifying the performance obligations in the contract; determining the transaction price; allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer (i.e., “transfer of control”).


Products (DSO, GSP and Ceautamed)

We primarily generate product revenues by manufacturing and packaging nutraceutical products as a contract manufacturer for our customers. The majority of our revenue is recognized when we satisfy a single performance obligation by transferring control of products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when our products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying contracts or agreements. Our general payment terms are short-term in duration. We do not have significant financing components or payment terms. We did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations at December 31, 2023 or 2022.

Distribution expenses to transport our products, where applicable, and warehousing expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.

Advertising/Marketing (Nexus)

Nexus generates advertising revenues when sales of listed products are sold by product vendors through its network as a result of the marketing efforts of digital marketers. The products on the network come from several different customers, which pay Nexus a specific amount per sale, the amount of which is dictated by the customer. The revenue is recognized upon the sale of a product by the customer, net of fraudulent traffic or disputed transactions. A portion of the specific amount received by Nexus for that sale is paid out to the digital marketer as a commission, which is recorded in cost of sales. To illustrate the revenue process, a digital marketer logs onto the platform and selects an offer to promote for the day. The platform generates a unique link which the digital marketer distributes either via email or a banner ad. As the link is distributed to the consumer via the marketing efforts of the digital marketer, the consumer visits that link to make a purchase from the customer’s website, and when such purchase is complete, revenue is recognized by Nexus and the sale is credited to the digital marketer’s Nexus account. The benefit to the digital marketer operating on Nexus’ network is that the digital marketer receives a commission without the possibility of a claw back or refund. The customer benefits through increased sales of its products as a result of the marketing efforts of the digital marketers. Nexus’ platform acts as the transaction ledger, keeping track of clicks, sales and commissions.

Nexus’ general payment terms are short-term in duration. Insertion orders are utilized between Nexus and the customer for each campaign related to a particular product being marketed. The insertion order remains in effect until the customer or Nexus terminates the order, and either party may terminate the order at any time upon 14 days’ written notice. The customer is billed weekly for the sales digital marketers have generated for the week. Nexus does not have significant financing components or payment terms. Nexus did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations at December 31, 2023 or 2022.

Inventory, net. Inventory consists of raw materials, packaging materials, and finished goods and is valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or replacement cost or net realizable value. An allowance for inventory obsolescence is provided for slow moving or obsolete inventory to write down historical cost to net realizable value. We primarily perform manufacturing for functional foods and nutraceuticals in the form of bars, cookies, powders, tablets and capsules. The allowance for obsolescence is an estimate established through charges to cost of goods sold. Management’s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based upon several factors which include, but are not limited to, analysis of slow-moving inventory, analysis of the selling price of inventory, the predetermined shelf life of the product, and management’s judgment with respect to current economic conditions. Given the nature of the inventory, it is reasonably possible our estimate of the allowance for obsolescence will change in the near term.

Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major betterments and additions are charged to the asset accounts, while replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred. We provide for depreciation and amortization over the estimated useful lives of various assets using the straight-line method ranging from 3-15 years.

Intangible Assets. In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Intangibles and Other, we review intangible assets for impairment. In connection with any such review, if the recorded value of intangible assets is greater than its fair value, they are written down and charged to results of operations. Intangible assets (excluding goodwill) are assessed at each reporting date for indications that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, we make an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. The asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the group of assets. Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, tradename, developed technology, patents, software platform, supplier contracts, non-compete agreements, license agreements, and intellectual property acquired in the acquisitions of DSO, Nexus, GSP and Ceautamed. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which ranges from 3 to 15 years.


Goodwill. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, we review intangible assets at least annually for impairment. In connection with any such review, if the recorded value of intangible assets is greater than its fair value, they are written down and charged to results of operations. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. In connection with the acquisition of DSO on July 1, 2021, we recognized goodwill which had a balance of $1,342,000 as of December 31, 2023. In connection with the acquisition of Nexus on November 8, 2021, we recognized goodwill which had a balance of $1,703,000 as of December 31, 2023. In connection with the acquisition of Ceautamed on July 29, 2022, we recognized goodwill which had a balance of $0 as of December 31, 2023

Long-Lived Assets. We assess potential impairments to long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) is less than its carrying amount. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results. We recognized an impairment of the intangible assets associated with Nexus during the year ended December 31, 2023 of $2,897,737. We recognized an impairment of the license agreement associated with GSP during the year ended December 31, 2023 of $342,531. We recognized an impairment of the intangible assets of Ceautamed during the year ended December 31, 2023 of $2,603,233. There were no impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Lease Right-of-Use Asset. We record a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified either as finance or operating with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and are discounted using the most reasonable incremental borrowing rate. We use the implicit rate when it is readily determinable. Since our lease does not provide an implicit rate, to determine the present value of lease payments, management uses our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement. Leases with a term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on our balance sheet and are expensed on a straight- line basis over the lease term.

Stock-based Compensation. We recognize expense for stock options and warrants granted over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award at the grant date, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair market value of the stock options. We calculate the amount of tax benefit available by tracking each stock option award on an employee-by-employee basis and on a grant-by-grant basis. We then compare the recorded expense to the tax deduction received for each stock option grant. Our policy is to recognize forfeitures as they occur.
