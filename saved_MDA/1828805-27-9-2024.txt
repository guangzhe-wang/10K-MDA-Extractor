Overview

We develop novel optoelectronic devices for sensing and communications applications. Aeluma has pioneered a technique to manufacture devices using high performance compound semiconductor materials on large-diameter substrates that are commonly used to manufacture mass market microelectronics. This enables cost-effective manufacturing of high-performance photodetectors and photodetector array circuits for imaging applications in mobile devices, as well as other technologies. This technology has the potential to enhance the performance and capability of camera image sensors, LiDAR, AR/VR, facial recognition, and other applications. Additionally, Aeluma’s technology may be used to manufacture other electronic and optoelectronic devices in the future including lasers, transistors, and solar cells.

Private Placements

Between December 2022 and May 2023, we entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreement”) with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 2,017,498 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a per share purchase price of $3.00, for aggregate gross proceeds of $6,052,500 (the “Offering”).

Pursuant to the Offering, we paid a cash placement agent fee of $411,015 and issued placement agent warrants to purchase up to 85,653 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. We also agreed to pay certain expenses of the placement agent in connection with the Offering.

In connection with the Subscription Agreement, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Investors, pursuant to which we agreed to register all of the shares of common stock issued in the Offering, including the shares of common stock underlying the warrant issued to the placement agent in this registration statement.

The closings of the Offering were exempt from registration under Section 4(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The common stock in the Offering was sold to “accredited investors,” as defined in Regulation D, and was conducted on a “reasonable best efforts” basis. 

Between August 5, 2024 and August 27, 2024, we issued convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,145,000 to 10 accredited investors, pursuant to a private note financing. The Notes mature in June 2026 and do not carry any interest. The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) upon the occurrence of certain events, (i.e., qualified financing resulting in at least $5,000,000 to the Company, if the Common Stock is uplisted to a national securities exchange or if neither of those such events occur prior to the maturity date, (together with Sale of the Company (as hereinafter defined), a “Conversion Event”)). The Note also provides that if there is a Sale of the Company, as defined in the Note, the Holder may elect to receive a cash payment equal to the aggregate amount of principal then outstanding under such Holder’s Note or convert the Note into shares of Common Stock equal to 85% of the VWAP of the Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five trading days immediately prior to the Sale of the Company. Although the conversion price is dependent upon the type of Conversion Event that occurs, the Note does carry a ceiling and floor price: the applicable conversion price will not be lower than 85% of the 5-day VWAP on the applicable Closing Date (the “Floor Price”) nor will the applicable conversion price be higher than $3.50 per share (the “Ceiling Price”); the Floor Price and Ceiling Price shall automatically adjust in the event of a stock split or consolidation by the Company. The Floor Price for the investors who participated in this initial closing is equal to $2.68 per share. Since the Floor Price is tied to the Closing Date, the Floor Price may be different for investors that are part of a different closing, should the Company hold additional closings. The Investors were granted piggyback registration rights for the shares of Common Stock underlying the Note.


The NPA also contains customary representation and warranties of the Company and the Investors, indemnification obligations of the Company, termination provisions, and other obligations and rights of the parties.

The foregoing description of the NPA and the Note is qualified by reference to the full text of the forms of NPA and Note, which are filed as Exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. 

Departure and Appointment of Directors and Officers

Mrs. Mehta decided not run for re-election in 2023; such decision was not the result of any disagreements with us on any matter related to the operations, policies, or practices of us. The Board nominated Mr. Craig Ensley to fill the vacancy on the Board; on December 14, 2023, the shareholders voted to elect Mr. Ensley to the board.

Plan of Operations

We have been developing our materials and characterization capabilities at our headquarters in Goleta, California, in connection with the further development of our business and the implementation of our plan of operations. We have installed key manufacturing equipment at our headquarters and will continue to develop relationships with manufacturing partners to carry out certain steps of our manufacturing processes externally. We have gained access to a rapid prototyping facility and are leveraging this access to fabricate early-stage prototypes. In the future, we intend to implement appropriate quality and manufacturing controls. Some equipment was procured previously, and other equipment is being procured through purchase orders with equipment vendors.

The primary sources of funding for equipment procurement and installation are the seed funding raised prior to becoming a public company and the funding raised from our financings. We have also leveraged funds to continue strengthening our intellectual property including patent applications, trademarks, and development of trade secrets and manufacturing process recipes. We will continue to develop our manufacturing and product development strategy by further engaging customers and strategic partners.

Limited Operating History

We cannot guarantee that the proceeds from the Offering will be sufficient to carry out all of our business plans. Our business is subject to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources, risks inherent in the research and development process and possible rejection of our products in development.

If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to carry out all of our operations. Equity financing will result in dilution to existing stockholders.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

Our revenue currently consists of commercial product sales and government contracts.

Operating Expenses

The cost of revenue consists of costs of materials, as well as direct compensation and expenses incurred to provide deliverables that resulted in payment of our success fee and wafers delivered. We anticipate that our cost of revenue will vary substantially depending on the nature of products and/or services delivered in each customer engagement. Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and employee benefits, costs associated with design, fabrication, packaging and testing of our devices, and facility lease and utility expenses. We expense research and development expenses as incurred.


General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and employee benefits. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party consulting, legal, insurance, audit and accounting services. 

Other Income

Other income, net of other expenses, consists primarily of interest income and income generated from subleasing a portion of our research and development facility. The sub-lease ended in March 2023

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense consists primarily of income taxes in certain state jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

Results of Operations

Year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023

Our results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, were as follows:

Revenue: Revenue increased $725,215, or 375.1 %, to $918,554, of which $64,756 was from commercial product and service contracts and $853,798 was from government contracts, for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $193,339, of which $15,000 was from commercial product and service contracts and $178,339 was from government contracts, for the same period in 2023.

Operating expenses: Operating expense decreased $221,162, or 3.9%, to $5,481,862 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $5,703,024 for the same period in 2023, due primarily to a reduction in consulting expenses, offset partially by increased salaries and stock-based compensation expenses.

Other income: Other income decreased $129,090, 99.2%, to $1,013 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from $130,103 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a $128,921 decrease in sub-lease income as the sublease ended in March 2023.

Income tax expense: We did not record income tax expense for either of the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Our financial statements have been presented on the basis that are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the financial statements, we incurred a net loss of $4,562,295 and $5,379,582 for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and losses are expected to continue in the near term. The accumulated deficit was $13,624,361 at June 30, 2024\. We have been funding our operations through the sale of common stock in private placement transactions.


Management anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to develop and expand our business before significant positive operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. At June 30, 2024, we had $1,291,072 of cash and cash equivalents. These funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need to seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Management has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) controlling overhead and expenses; (c) executing material sales or research contracts; and (d) pursuing additional sales and contracts. There can be no assurance that we can successfully accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that we will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. As of the date of this Report, we have not entered into any formal agreements regarding the above.

In the event we are unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not considered this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence. 

We had working capital of $766,160 and $4,576,807 at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Current assets decreased $3,941,060 to $1,392,846 at June 30, 2024 from $5,333,906 at June 30, 2023, primarily due to a $3,780,618 decrease in cash. Current liabilities decreased $130,413 to $626,686 at June 30, 2024 from $757,099 at June 30, 2023, due primarily to decreases in accounts payable.

The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:

Net cash used in our operating activities were $3,454,779 and $3,637,972 for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due primarily to net losses of $4,562,295 and $5,379,582 for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net cash used in our investing activities was $321,838 and $672,545 for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investing activities include purchase of equipment and payment for leasehold improvements.

Net cash used in our financing activities was $4,001 for the year ended June 30, 2024 and net cash provided by our financing activities was $5,641,485 for the year ended June 30, 2023. We paid $4,001 to purchase Lee McCarthy’s unvested restricted shares for the year ended June 30, 2024 and received $5,641,284 from Private Placements, net of $411,015 offering cost.
